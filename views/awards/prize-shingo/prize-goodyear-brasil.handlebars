        <h4>Vision</h4>
        <p>The Americana team’s vision is simple: Become the most competitive tire supplier in the world. To achieve our vision, we rely on associates to grow our business and satisfy customers. The team is attaining this goal by incorporating five values:</p>
        <p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety is no longer a first priority – it is now our highest value. Goodyear Americana’s Total Safety Culture program demands associates internalize the value, both inside and outside of the plant. The program’s importance is solidified through the TSC flag flying in front of the plant.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> We pride ourselves in offering the right product, at the right time, in the right quantity. Our products meet expectations of quality for customers. We focus on every component, every assembly and every cure to assure our pride is well-deserved.</p>
        <p><strong>Environment &amp; Social Responsibility:</strong> We have the responsibility to leave the earth, air, and water in the same good condition it was when we built the plant. We have improved the area by:
            <ul class="square">
                <li>Planting nearly 11,000 trees</li>
                <li>Working to achieve the Triple Zero concept (zero waste to landfill, zero non-conformities and zero solvents)</li>
                <li>Drawing water from the Piracicaba River for the production process, and returning cleaner than when it was removed</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> The Americana Plant works on the continuous improvement of its products and processes by giving all employees the opportunity to contribute with new ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Organizational Capability:</strong> Reaching our goals requires a talented, well-trained workforce that feels passionate about the business. Ongoing training, certifications, evaluations and constant feedbacks assure the continuous development. The team is eager to improve the Americana Plant and achieve our goal of becoming the most competitive tire supplier in the world.</p>
