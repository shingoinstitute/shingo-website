		<h4><strong>Corporate Overview</strong></h4>
			<p>Rexam is a leading global beverage can maker with sales in the region of $6.5 billion in 2014. We have 55 can making plants in more than 20 countries and employ around 8,000 people. Headquartered in London, England, we are an established member of the FTSE 100. We are business partners to some of the world’s most famous and successful consumer brands such as Coca-Cola, Red Bull, Heineken, and PepsiCo.</p>
			<p>Our vision to “be the best global consumer packaging company” is strongly supported by Rexam’s five embedded core values: <em>Continuous Improvement</em> that is always seeking perfection; <em>Trust</em> meaning loyalty to each other in a respectful way and commitment to our customers, our community and the environment, <em>Teamwork</em> to get the best outcome, together; <em>Recognition</em> to our most important asset, our people; and <em>Safety</em> – recently named in our five values and is consistent with respecting every individual.</p>
			<p>We have been committed to a path of lean enterprise across all our operations as a way of putting our values into practice for over ten years. This approach is an essential part of what we call the “Rexam Way.”</p>
		<h5><strong>The Rexam México Facility</strong></h5>
			<p>Rexam Beverage Can Americas S. A. de C.V is based in Querétaro, Mexico. The operation was formed as a joint venture in September 1995 by partners Vitro and Rexam until October 2004 when Rexam acquired 100% of the assets; supplying Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean area.</p>
			<p>Of the 159 people on site, there are 140 involved in plant operations and management and 19 people are responsible for finance, logistics and sales. The 520,000 sq. ft. facility has three aluminum can manufacturing lines, two for 12-oz. and one for 24-oz. sizes dedicated to customers such as Coca-Cola, Heineken, Hornell and Modelo, with a total production of 3.9 million 12-oz. cans and 1.1million 24-oz. cans each day. The plant operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we are relentlessly working to exceed our customer expectations.</p>
		<h5><strong>Product and Process</strong></h5>
			<p>The site is capable of producing two sizes of beverage cans, 12 oz. and 24 oz., for 18 customers, resulting in over 200 active label options (designs). The ability to continuously improve changeover times to meet requirements for smaller lot sizes and make faster deliveries is at the heart of maintaining a competitive advantage.</p>
			<p>To make a beverage can, the key process steps involve stamping and drawing aluminum discs from rolled stock to form a can shape. The cans are then washed before being labeled using in-line screen printers. They are then shipped to our customers filling locations across Mexico and Central America.</p>
			<p>Speed and quality are the key drivers of process performance, and our OMS and QAS (Statistical Quality System), Manufacturing Operations Management and Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence provide real-time production data and process monitoring capability.</p>
		<h5><strong>Continuous Improvement Process</strong></h5>
			<p>Rexam has operated a global system of lean enterprise since 2003, structured around building capability in specific tool sets of culture, VSM, 5S, TPM, SMED and six sigma.</p>
			<p>Rexam’s best plants were invited to participate in a more sophisticated assessment known as “Beyond Gold,” where the implementation of lean systems is appraised. A system of merit is used to recognize achievement starting at Emerald, then Sapphire, and finally Diamond. In recognition of our lean efforts, we became the first plant in Rexam North America to be awarded “Beyond Gold” diamond level twice.</p>
