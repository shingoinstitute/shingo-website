          <h4>People</h4>
          <p>Barnes Aerospace Fabrication associates have a long history of creating a culture that strives for continuous improvement and customer satisfaction in a safe working environment. Our associates make our True North strategy a success by 1) working as a cohesive team towards operational excellence; 2) continual pursuit of customer satisfaction through on- time-delivery, uncompromised quality, and pro- active communications; 3) profit growth for our shareholders; and, 4) volunteer community service.</p>
          <p>We are benefiting from a 230% increase from 2007 in documented and implemented improvement suggestions - excluding the countless employee “just do it” daily Kaizen implemented improvements - which are leveraged across the organization. All associates benefit from a weekly “Autonomy Time” dedicated to self-improvement.</p>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>Our lean journey began in 2000 by focusing on the implementation of systems and tools from the Toyota Production System. From 2000 to late 2006 improvement activities were driven from single event based activities, pushed down to associates from the leadership team, yielding low levels of sustainment.</p>
          <p>In 2007, Ogden’s leadership team utilizing Barnes Enterprise System (BES), which closely aligns with the Shingo model, focused on teaching, empowering, aligning our systems, tools and behaviors to achieve maximum results. By unleashing the untapped human creativity of our associates, we are experiencing step change and sustained improvement activities across the entire organization.</p>
          <p>The leadership team performs structured daily GEMBA walks, ensuring that the entire facility is engaged on a weekly basis. Leadership serves to support and remove constraints in order for our associates to deliver value and drive continuous improvement. Associates review performance measurements, as well as showcase their team’s newly implemented ideas.</p>
          <h4>Facility</h4>
          <p>In 2009, a 160,000-square-foot manufacturing facility was built using the most current lean flow tools. All of our associates participated in at least one Kaizen event centered on flow, in order to develop cell and support area layouts. Our facility houses three Value Stream operating units, each of which is focused on new product introduction, sheet metal fabrications, and airframe assemblies.</p>
          <h4>Corporation</h4>
          <p>Barnes Aerospace Fabrications Ogden division is a P &amp; L operating segment of Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE:B), a diversified global manufacturer and logistical services company with 60 locations on four continents and 4800 employees delivering on our promises to our customers, ensuring exacting performance, superior support and service, and impactful results.</p>
