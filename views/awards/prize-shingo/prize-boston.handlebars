					<br><strong>Boston Scientific Cork</strong><br>
					In 1997, Boston Scientific acquired a 30-acre site in Cork, Ireland, that included a 25,000 ft<sup>2</sup> facility featuring a historic protected building, the Munster Institute (20,000 ft2).  The Cork manufacturing facility supports the Boston Scientific Peripheral Interventions, Endoscopy, Interventional Cardiology and Urology and Pelvic Health businesses.  The site has an annual output of 5.5 million units per year, works a two-shift operation over a five-day week and has a workforce of 800 employees of whom 570 are product builders and the rest work in support roles.<br>
					<br><strong>Our Products</strong><br>
					Boston Scientific Cork manufactures a diversified portfolio of medical devices for distribution across the globe. The product portfolio includes active and access catheters, occlusion coils and microspheres, inflation devices and atherectomy devices. As a worldwide manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, the Cork facility operates under a Global Quality System. This System addresses the management responsibility, resource management, product realization, measurement, analysis and improvement of products in fulfilment of all applicable regulations and standards.<br><br>
					Our Quality policy is “I Improve the Quality of Patient Care and all things Boston Scientific” and every employee takes ownership for quality and understands how his or her performance directly impacts patient care.<br>
					<br><stron>Site Vision and Strategy</strong><br>
					The Cork site vision is “To be the Highest Performing Global Medical Solution Provider” by focusing on patient care, as defined by our Guiding Priorities. Our Strategic Quality Process (SQP) is a key driver in how we run the business. The SQP enables us to prioritize, execute and monitor activities and align resources accordingly. Our site balanced scorecard aligns the team to the SQP and forms the basis of our Core Team metrics. The Reward and Recognition of our employees underpins the process.<br>
					<br><strong>Our Ideal Behaviors</strong><br>
					Our Ideal Behaviors were developed by our teams within Cork and are reinforced by our philosophy:<br>
					<blockquote>“I want to be here…I do my best work here”.</blockquote>
					The site Ideal Behaviors are closely aligned to the Boston Scientific Global Core Values of Caring, Diversity, Global Collaboration, High Performance, Meaningful Innovation and Winning Spirit. Together, they reinforce an open and honest work environment where trust and respect prevails thereby allowing engagement at all levels of the organization to the benefit of all.<br>
					<br><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong><br>
					Continuous Improvement has been at the core of the Cork site’s culture since its inception. Over time, the team has implemented a number of programs and initiatives to strengthen our focus on continuous improvement at all levels. For instance, the team adopted Lean as a formal strategy in 2001 to improve production and business processes. The Lean tools and systems have become our standard for doing business and have evolved and improved over time as our business has grown. In 2012, we introduced Shingo as a platform to drive cultural change and to engage and involve everyone in the future of the business. With a daily focus on Team Huddles, Tier Meetings, Leaders Standard Work, Continuous Improvement and Problem Solving, core and functional teams have had the tools and opportunities to identify and rectify critical issues in their areas more quickly and efficiently.<br><br>
					We are continually training employees deeper in the organization on skills such as problem solving so they too can have a more active role in finding improvement opportunities.  Additionally, our continuous improvement culture is benefited by our Value Improvement Process (VIP) that drives process improvements where cost reduction, product quality enhancement, customer responsiveness and waste elimination are the goals. Together, these programs and activities allow us to identify, prioritize and execute projects that create value for our customers. We regularly celebrate our Continuous Improvement culture at our annual Recognize Success Fair, which has been in place for 17 years.<br>
					<br><strong>Customers</strong><br>
					Boston Scientific is committed to offering its customers the deepest, most innovative and cost-effective portfolio of products and solutions in the market.
