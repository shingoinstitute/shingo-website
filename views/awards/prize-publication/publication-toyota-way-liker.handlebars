He is author of the international best-seller, “The Toyota Way” and many more related articles and books, which have earned him an astonishing 13 Shingo awards. Ms. Ross, an experienced consultant, highly skilled coach and accomplished lean practitioner, specializes in teaching organizations how to use creativity in combination with the ground-tested principles and practices of “The Toyota Way.</p> 
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.
        A must-read for service professionals of every level, “The Toyota Way to Service Excellence” takes the proven Lean principles of the bestselling “Toyota Way” series and applies them directly to the industries where quality of service is crucial for success. Dr. Liker and Ms. Ross show how to develop Lean practices throughout an organization using the famous 4P model. Whether you are an executive, manager, consultant, or frontline worker who deals with customers every day, you’ll learn how take advantage of all Lean has to offer.</p>
        <p>With this book as a guide, you’ll gain a clear understanding of Lean and discover the principles, practices and tools needed to develop people and processes that surprise and delight customers. These ground-tested techniques are designed to help make continuous improvements in services, streamline operations, and add ever-increasing value to customers. Fascinating case studies of Lean-driven success in a range of service industries, including healthcare, insurance, financial services, and telecommunications, illustrate that Lean principles and practices work as well in services as they do in manufacturing. Drawn from original research and real-world examples, “The Toyota Way to Service Excellence” will help you make the leap to Lean.</p>
        <p>H. Thomas Johnson, emeritus professor of business at Portland State University (Oregon) and two-time Shingo Research Award recipient says, “I wish to commend to all service industry executives the new book ‘The Toyota Way to Service Excellence’ by Jeffrey K. Liker and Karyn Ross. Building on Liker's earlier award-winning book ‘The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World's Greatest Manufacturer,’ the Liker and Ross book is a brilliant and eminently readable account of how to apply Toyota's principles of operational excellence to service industries. At long last, ‘The Toyota Way to Service Excellence’ provides leaders of service organizations a comprehensive guide to the thinking and practices underlying Toyota's revolutionary and world-changing approach to lean operations management.”</p>
        <p>Michael Ballé, Shingo award-winning author and co-founder of the French Lean Institute, also says, “Jeff shares with us another great book on the Toyota Way, not just by expanding the thinking to service, but also by clarifying again his deeper thoughts about the Toyota Way itself, in its clearest expression yet. Jeff and Karyn also make a wonderful job of showing very practical ways to jump into service issues with the Toyota Way, in a language adapted to service cultures. A delightful read, and a real success.”</p>
        <p>The authors will receive the award at the awards ceremony during the Shingo International Conference in Atlanta, Georgia, USA on April 24-28, 2017. The conference is a week-long event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
