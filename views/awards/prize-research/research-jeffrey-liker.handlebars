          <h5><strong>“Developing Lean Leaders at all Levels” by Jeffrey K. Liker (with George Trachilis) Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
  				<br><br>
  				<p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of their work, Jeffrey K. Liker with George Trachilis have been selected as recipients of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The author and contributor will receive the award at the 28th International Shingo Conference occurring April 25-29, 2016 in Washington DC. </p>
  				<p>LOGAN, Utah — The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Jeffrey K. Liker, Ph.D., with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for his book, “Developing Lean Leaders at all Levels: A Practical Guide.” Dr. Liker is professor of industrial and operations engineering at the University of Michigan and president of Liker Lean Advisors, LLC – a collection of top-notch lean advisors. He is an international best-selling author and recipient of 11 Shingo Research Awards. Trachilis, president and CEO at Lean Leadership Institute Inc., is a partner with Dr. Liker and a contributor to this book.</p>
  				<p> “Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute. </p>
  				<p>In “The Toyota Way to Lean Leadership,” Dr. Liker and Toyota-veteran Gary Convis unveiled the secret of Toyota’s success in developing leaders who live the values and constantly improve the company and adapt to the rapidly changing environment. In “Developing Leaders at all Levels,” Dr. Liker builds on the theory in the original book and its four-stage model of leadership development: self development, developing others, supporting daily improvement, and aligning people throughout the entire enterprise using a common strategic planning process called hoshin kanri. The Lean Leadership Development Model (LLDM) presented in this book is intuitive and aligns well with accepted principles of operational excellence. It expands significantly on the elements of lean, structuring them in a more specific way that can be operationalized by lean practitioners. “Developing Lean Leaders” is a management must-read, and its purpose is to help you learn, practice and grow your lean leadership skills.</p>
  				<p>Dr. Liker says, “I am delighted to be recognized by the Shingo Research Award committee. I have great respect for what the Shingo Institute is doing to promote true lean and emphasize leadership and culture change. In ‘The Toyota Way to Lean Leadership, also a Shingo Research Award recipient, Gary Convis and I describe a four-stage model of leadership development and illustrate it with examples from Toyota. Of course, few companies are like Toyota in the experience and depth of commitment to deliberately develop a certain type of leader. ‘Developing Lean Leaders,’ and the online course this was based on, goes a step further. How can people in organizations that are not Toyota develop a model of leadership consistent with lean principles, and then step-by-step introduce that to the culture? It is challenging, time consuming and requires great passion. But it is possible and I share examples of leaders and organizations that have done it. These two books are great companion volumes and will contribute to your self-development. Please read, act, reflect and learn!” </p>
  				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards. </p>
  				<p>Dr. Liker and Trachillis will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in Washington D.C. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence. </p>
  				<h5><strong>About the Shingo Institute</strong></h5>
  				<p>Housed at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, the Shingo Institute is named after Japanese industrial engineer Shigeo Shingo. Shingo distinguished himself as one of the world’s thought leaders in concepts, management systems and improvement techniques that have become known as the Toyota Business System. Drawing from Shingo’s teachings and years of experience working with organizations throughout the world, the Shingo Institute has developed the <em>Shingo Model™</em> which is the basis for several educational offerings including workshops, study tours, conferences and the Shingo MBA. It also awards and recognizes organizations that demonstrate an exceptional culture that continually strives for improvement and progress.
