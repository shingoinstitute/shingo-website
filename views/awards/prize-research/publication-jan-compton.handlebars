        <h5><strong>“Achieving Safe Health Care” by Jan Compton Receives Shingo Publication Award</strong></h5>
				<p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of this work, Jan Compton has been selected as recipient of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. Compton will receive the award at the 29th International Shingo Conference occurring April 24-28, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah — The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Jan Compton with the Shingo Publication Award for the book, “Achieving Safe Health Care.” Jan Compton, vice president of patient safety and chief patient safety officer for Baylor Scott & White Health (BSWH), the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas, will accept the award on BSWH’s behalf.</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
				<p>A recent article published in the Journal of Patient Safety estimated that more than 400,000 lives are lost each year due to preventable patient events in American hospitals. Preventable patient safety events are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. While most healthcare organizations are aware of and prioritize improving patient safety, many are unsure of the steps required to develop, implement and sustain an effective patient safety program.</p>
				<p>BSWH has successfully created a strong culture of patient safety. In 2013, Baylor Health Care System published the book “Achieving STEEEP® Health Care,” which describes its quality improvement journey via the STEEEP framework of delivering care that is safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable and patient-centered. “Achieving Safe Health Care” provides a detailed overview of the BSWH approach to the delivery of safe care, the leading aim of the STEEEP quality and patient safety framework. It presents real-life examples, practical approaches and tools for improving patient safety.</p>
				<p>Beth Mancini, professor, associate dean and chair of the Undergraduate Nursing Programs at the University of Texas, says, “Baylor Scott & White Health’s approach to achieving the Triple Aim is both innovative and proven. This book provides the practical information and real-life examples that individuals and organizations will find extraordinarily useful to improve and enhance care in their settings...it is a ‘must have’ for anyone interested in maximizing patient safety.”</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
				<p>Compton will receive the award at the Awards Gala of the 29th International Shingo Conference in Atlanta, Georgia the week of April 24, 2017. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
