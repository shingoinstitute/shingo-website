          <p>The Shingo Prize is based on a complete assessment of an organization’s culture and how well it drives world-class results. Shingo examiners focus on the degree to which the <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em> of the <em>Shingo Model™</em> are evident in the behavior of every employee. The examiners observe behavior and determine the frequency, duration, intensity and scope of the desired principle-based behavior. They also observe the degree to which leaders focus on principles and culture, and managers focus on aligning systems to drive ideal behaviors at all levels.</p>
          <p>This focus is unique in the world and is the most rigorous way to determine whether an organization is fundamentally improving for the long-term, or just going through the motions of another flavor-of-the-month initiative.</p>
          <p>Organizations that receive Shingo recognition fall into three categories:</p>
          <ul class="square">
            <li><strong>Shingo Prize</strong> - a worldwide recognized symbol of an organization’s successful establishment of a culture anchored on principles of enterprise excellence</li>
            <li><strong>Shingo Silver Medallion</strong> - organizations maturing on the journey with primary focus on tools and systems for improvement</li>
            <li><strong>Shingo Bronze Medallion</strong> – organizations in the earlier stages of cultural transformation with primary focus on tools for improvement</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most organizations do not wait to challenge for the Shingo Prize until they are likely to win it. Rather, they use their challenge as part of their progression as a way to guide their journey of continuous improvement. Many organizations do not intend to ever challenge for the Shingo Prize but use the <em>Shingo Model™</em> as the standard of excellence to which they aspire.</p>

              <p>*Note: Achievement reports will be accepted at anytime throughout the year. Achievement reports not received in time to process before the International Shingo Conference and Awards Ceremony (usually held in April or May) will be recognized at the following International Shingo Conference and Awards Ceremony.</p>
              <p>If you are trying to assure recognition at a specific year’s International Shingo Conference, you should submit your achievement report by August 1. If the achievement report is turned in after this date, we will process it as quickly as possible on a FIFO basis. It still may be processed in time for the conference.</p>
