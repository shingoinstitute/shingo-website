        <p>The Shingo Prize is based on a complete assessment of an organization’s culture and how well it drives world-class
            results. Shingo examiners focus on the degree to which the <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em> of the <em>Shingo Model™</em> are evident in the behavior of every employee. The examiners observe behavior and determine the frequency, duration,
            intensity and scope of the desired principle-based behavior. They also observe the degree to which leaders focus
            on principles and culture, and managers focus on aligning systems to drive ideal behaviors at all levels.</p>
        <p>This focus is unique in the world and is the most rigorous way to determine whether an organization is fundamentally
            improving for the long-term, or just going through the motions of another flavor-of-the-month initiative.</p>
        <p>Most organizations do not wait to challenge for the Shingo Prize until they are likely to win it. Rather, they use
            their challenge as part of their progression as a way to guide their journey of continuous improvement. Many
            organizations do not intend to ever challenge for the Shingo Prize but use the <em>Shingo Model™</em> as the
            standard of excellence to which they aspire.</p>

                your achievement report by August 1. If the achievement report is turned in after this date, we will process
                it as quickly as possible on a FIFO basis. It still may be processed in time for the conference.</p>
