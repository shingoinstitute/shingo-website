		<h3>Cardinal Health Quiroproductos Receives International Recognition for Operational Excellence</h3>
        <p><em>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of its facility, Cardinal Health Quiroproductos de Cuauhtémoc has been awarded the internationally recognized Shingo Bronze Medallion from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business.</em></p>
        <p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, a program in the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Cardinal Health Quiroproductos de Cuauhtémoc S. de R.L. de C.V. in Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua, Mexico with the Shingo Bronze Medallion.</p>
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Bronze Medallion signifies an organization’s mastery of fundamental tools and techniques for improving an organization's operations,” said Ken Snyder, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Organizations that receive the Bronze Medallion are making great progress on their journey to achieving enterprise excellence.”</p>
        <p>The Shingo Bronze Medallion is the third of three awards bestowed on organizations by the Shingo Institute. The highest achievement is the Shingo Prize.</p>
        <p>The Quiroproductos facility started operations in Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua, Mexico in 1990 and was later acquired by Cardinal Health in 1999. Today, the Cuauhtémoc facility manufactures more than 231 million units of medical disposable products each year, including surgical drapes for different types of medical procedures, face masks, surgical gowns with all types of doctor-patient protection, back table covers, multi-packs and some pouches.</p>
        <p>Sergio A. Avitia, Quiroproductos’ manufacturing director, says, “It gives us all great pride to say that we help save lives. Without a doubt, contributing to the manufacturing of medical products carries a responsibility and an additional satisfaction.” Avitia continues, “Whenever we talk about continuous improvement, we like to learn from the best... That is the main reason we decided to assess ourselves with the Shingo methodology. Without a doubt, this has great prestige at the international level… We believe we are on the right track and this motivates the team to accept greater challenges and celebrate our triumphs.”</p>
        <p>Ramon Quintana, who is instrumental in Quiroproductos’ operational excellence, also says, “Quiroproductos de Cuauhtemoc and the Cardinal Health operating system, which is based on the Shingo Guiding Principles, has enabled our most valuable resource – our employees – to passionately empower processes and look for continuous improvement, thus creating the value that our customers need. I am very proud to be a part of the greatest team at Quiroproductos de Cuauhtemoc and to also have contributed to the achievement of this great world-class award.</p>
        <p>Quiroproductos has noted a number of significant improvements from FY12 to FY17. Complaints per million dramatically reduced from an average of 2.45 to .58, and the total recordable incident rate was reduced by 80% from 1.24 to .24. In FY12, the percentage of people involved in operational excellence was 51% and now it is currently 91.5%. Frontline employees have improved the number of performed short kaizen events by 88%, and leadership has improved the performed number of kaizen events by 24%.</p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results.</p>
        <p>Team members from Cardinal Health Quiroproductos will receive the award during the Awards Gala at the 30th Shingo Conference held the week of April 9-13, 2018 in Orlando, Florida, USA. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
