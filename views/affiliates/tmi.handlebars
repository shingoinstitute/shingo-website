            <p>The Manufacturing Institute (TMI) is an independent charity organized 21 years ago to inspire, educate and improve manufacturing. Its story is about hard work, innovation, nurturing talent, sharing experiences and passionately supporting manufacturing. Over the last two decades TMI has educated over 50,000 manufacturers in best practice; worked in over 10,000 manufacturing companies across the world; and achieved over £1 billion of quality, cost and delivery impacts. TMI has a reputation for trail blazing new ideas to support manufacturing, and has helped multiple organizations achieve Shingo recognition, including the first two sites recognized in Europe – Ultraframe and BAE systems, and the first three full Shingo Prize recipients in Europe – Abbott Vascular, DePuy Synthes and Newsprinters Eurocentral.</p>
            <p>TMI’s practitioners have worked in manufacturing businesses of all sizes and sectors, driving improvement and delivering results. They know exactly what it takes to successfully introduce and, importantly, sustain any change program, whatever the scale. Its team will give you the tools, insights and confidence to not only strengthen your own capabilities, but also to improve the performance of your business, and help lay the foundations for success for decades to come.</p>
