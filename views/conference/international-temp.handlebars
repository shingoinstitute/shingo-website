                                <p><strong>Bill Baker &amp; Ken Rolfes</strong></p>
                                <p>Lean typically originates within the operations functions of a business. After initial successes with foundational lean tools, such as 5S, standardized work and the visual workplace, attention turns to accelerating the
                                    flow of materials and information. Many organizations plateau and become disillusioned when they don't see the bottom-line results originally anticipated. When this occurs, lean efforts are often abandoned while the
                                    organization comforts itself with the notion lean was not applicable to its business, or “We’ve done lean, now what’s next?” Why does this occur and how can it be avoided?</p>
                                <p>The answer can be traced to the original impetus for the lean initiative and its advertised benefits. There are two kinds of lean efforts. The most common is the tools approach centered on eliminating wastes with pull systems,
                                    kaizen events, quick changeovers, etc. Most can recite the eight different wastes. Many recognize that any organization will never completely eliminate all wastes, and assume that an organization tenaciously pursuing
                                    waste elimination with a continuous improvement mindset will by default achieve operational improvements. As a result, only a few functional departments in the company adopt lean.</p>
                                <p>The other approach is strategic lean where leading-edge companies recognize and adopt lean as a management system to build leadership, productivity and growth. Leading companies from the outset articulate expectations for
                                    the organization to be able to measure success. Lean-focused organizations identify the customer value derived from the products and services they offer and continually work to improve the value delivered and the processes
                                    employed to deliver that value. In summary, strategic lean is a customer-centric business model and a lean management system to support the model.</p>
                                <p>In this workshop attendees will learn how to move beyond the tools approach and begin to connect the dots with their company’s business model and translate the benefits of a lean initiative into financial metrics. Specifically,
                                    to see lean as an organizational strategy for driving growth, profitability and capability to continually transform the business to benefit from the continually changing market place.</p>

                                <p><strong>George Trachilis</strong></p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>You can learn everything you want about the Toyota Way. You can implement the tools they have created, but if you do not have the behaviors established within your culture, it will not be successful for long-term sustainment
                                    of operational excellence. Leadership must walk the talk of true north in every aspect of the Lean Leadership Development Model (LLDM) as conveyed in detail by Dr. Jeffrey Liker and Gary Convis.</p>
                                <p>The LLDM is the centerpiece of this entire workshop. George Trachilis, a professional engineer and master lean coach, presents this workshop based on Dr. Liker’s 2016 Shingo Research Award-winning book, <em>Developing Lean Leaders at All Levels: A Practical Guide</em>.
                                    As an award recipient for his contribution to the book, Mr. Trachilis will expand significantly on the elements of lean, structuring them in a specific way that can be operationalized by leadership in any industry.</p>
                                <p>The workshop structure will take the form of the LLDM and include discussion on the true north values of the Toyota Way, Toyota business practices, and the Toyota kata methodology. The four steps of the LLDM are 1) Commit
                                    to Self-Development, 2) Coach and Develop Others, 3) Support Daily Kaizen, and 4) Hoshin Kanri. The workshop answers the questions:</p>
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>What critical tools are needed to turn the theory to practice?</li>
                                    <li>How can I apply this in my organization?</li>
                                    <li>What concrete actions can I take to begin the journey of becoming a lean leader?</li>
                                    <li>How can I spread this learning to all parts of the organization?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Mr. Trachilis will share examples from Dr. Liker’s more than 20 years of experience (via video format) in working with companies outside of Toyota, as well as his own perspective as a 20+-year lean practitioner who has
                                    been implementing aspects of the Toyota Way in companies around the world. Mr. Trachilis will also share some of the tips and tricks he uses to engage long-distance learning students. All participants of this workshop
                                    will receive lifetime access at no cost to the online course that Dr. Liker presents.</p>

                                <p><strong>John Lee</strong></p>
                                <p>One of the reasons companies have such short life spans is because they do not understand how to effectively transform themselves. John Lee, author of <em>Rising Above It All</em> and president of Alpha Quality Consulting,
                                    defines organizational transformation as evolving to higher levels of sustained performance. He has found that most companies are capable of evolving to a given level of performance – the 95% level. One of the problems
                                    in transformation is that the skill set needed to reach the 95% performance level is not the same skill set needed to rise above the 95% level of performance. Most organizations do not understand this phenomenon; and
                                    as a result, companies will eventually go extinct as customer expectations rise.</p>
                                <p>In this interactive workshop, participants will learn how to implement the three elements of transformation – personal transformation, cultural transformation and tools transformation. Most companies skip the personal and
                                    cultural transformation and jump right into the tools transformation, which is the reason companies die at such a young age. Organizations need a culture that supports modern-day analytical tools, including tools used
                                    in the planning process, or the tools will not effectively work within the borders of the organization. Participants will learn how to incorporate all three elements of a transformation by creating a supply chain built
                                    from catapults and other raw materials. This team-based activity is applicable to real-life and will help you gain inspiration to the wonders of lifting your organization “above it all.”</p>

                                <p><strong>Daniel Markovitz</strong></p>
                                <p>The corporate landscape is littered with the carcasses of companies that have failed in their pursuit of the Toyota Way. Their efforts fail precisely because they’re trying to copy Toyota. </p>
                                <p>Trying to be like Toyota is a mistake. What leaders need to do instead is learn from Toyota—learn how to convert their competent organizations into dynamic, constantly improving, profoundly customer-focused entities. A
                                    “fit” organization has the ability to continually improve in a manner that delivers superior performance and results over the long haul. </p>
                                <p>This workshop, based on the Shingo Research Award-winning book, <em>Building the Fit Organization</em>, distills the lessons from the Toyota Production System into six core concepts, and couches them in the easily understandable
                                    language of physical fitness and athletic excellence—no Japanese, no English jargon, and no off-putting references to Toyota. By the end of the workshop, your team will be ready to make your organization faster, more
                                    competitive, and better able to win in your market. </p>
                                <p>This workshop combines lecture with group exercises to help you develop an approach for embedding continuous improvement mindsets and behaviors in the unique environment of your organization. </p>

                                <p><strong>Mike Orzen</strong></p>
                                <p>Building a great organization requires effective leadership. It turns out that leadership skills can be learned and mastered; however, a key element that is often misunderstood is what it means to lead with respect. This
                                    workshop explores why leading with respect is essential in a successful transformation, what respect looks like in practice, and how it impacts your people to drive lasting change for the better. </p>
                                <p>Leading with respect involves awareness of our focus and how effectively we are connecting with people to create sustained high levels of performance. This is accomplished through the application of seven core practices: </p>
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>Go and See for Yourself</li>
                                    <li>Creating a Meaningful Challenge</li>
                                    <li>Effective Listening</li>
                                    <li>Teaching and Coaching</li>
                                    <li>Supporting Others</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Organizations are a reflection of their leadership, and if change needs to happen, it often needs to begin at the top. Through practice, we learn and gradually begin to master the seven practices to become more effective
                                    leaders and create healthier high-performance organizations. This is a personal journey of growth, sometimes quite challenging, which transforms individuals and companies. It is tough work and not for someone who believes
                                    that needed changes do not include themselves. Come and learn what leading with respect is all about, and discover how to drive new behaviors and results in your company. </p>

                                <p>The Cleveland Clinic Improvement Model (clevelandclinic.org/improve) is a model that was developed with its foundation in the <em>Shingo Model</em>™. Recognizing that behaviors and actions are different for senior leaders,
                                    managers and associates has helped create a focus on four key systems - Organizational Alignment, Visual Management, Problem Solving and Standardization. The Clinic has utilized this model across its health system to
                                    deliver measurable outcome improvements and significant cultural transformations. You can see an example of this work at <a href="https://youtu.be/eRZDCYESFaU">here</a>.</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>Improving “leanness” should show up as quicker response, better quality, lower costs—and, prominently, rising inventory turnover. Yet, research involving more than 1,500 global companies shows long-term value-chain inventory
                                    turns falling, rising, falling ... in multi-year cycles, with nearly all regions showing worsening inventory turns in the new millennium. Grouped by industry sector, the studies show electrical products with the best
                                    multi-year leanness trends, and process-industry companies (e.g., pharmaceuticals, basic metals, and textiles) among the poorest. Other findings point to tendencies for companies to focus inwardly on operations (WIP),
                                    as opposed to customer-oriented external flows (finished goods)—contrary to the <em>Shingo Guiding Principle</em> of Creating Value for the Customer. The research suggests, further, that consistently rising inventory
                                    turns may serve as a useful indicator of adherence to the <em>Shingo Guiding Principle</em> of Enterprise Alignment, and a catch-all indicator of organizational effectiveness. Dr. Richard Schonberger will discuss the
                                    global leanness studies and share how they relate to the <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em>.</p>

                                    healthcare workers clearly demonstrate both the potential and the challenges of lean implementation; but the results using Shingo’s zero quality control methods were instrumental in dramatically improving patient safety
                                    and satisfaction and lowering organizational costs.</p>

                                <p>This session will focus on the “why, how and what” of a lean transformation in an American healthcare system. Dr. Patricia Gabow will establish the why for the transformation and present the how by demonstrating that lean
                                    is an ideal approach at the individual health system level. She will highlight this approach by presenting the lean journey at Denver Health, a large urban safety net healthcare system. The what of such a lean journey
                                    will include quality, cost, and employee satisfaction outcomes, along with the lessons learned during the lean transformation.</p>

                                <p>“Nationwide is On Your Side” is more than a tagline. It’s a promise made to customers to protect what matters most. A big part of that promise is kept through a lean journey that started seven years ago. With recognition
                                    that IT is increasingly a key differentiator, Nationwide embarked on a lean IT transformation in 2009 to build industry-leading software engineering capabilities. Fast-forward to the present, and the lean transformation
                                    has enabled this 9000+ person IT organization to deliver great solutions to customers and partners with industry-leading quality.</p>
                                <p>Tom Paider, associate vice president and build capability leader, will present a lean system that guides all aspects of software engineering, including a lean management system from the frontline to the C-Suite. He will
                                    focus on problem solving, transparency and accountability, and he will describe what is possible when technology and lean collide.</p>

                                <p>The most common approach to customer loyalty today is devoting limitless time, energy and resources trying to dazzle people and inspire customers’ undying loyalty. But the book from CEB, <em>The Effortless Experience</em>,
                                    uses over five years of research and tens of thousands of respondents to reveal that the “dazzle factor” is wildly overrated. Consider this: what do customers really want from their cable company – a free month of HBO
                                    when it screws up, or a fast, painless restoration of your connection? Do they want a personal relationship with their bank teller, or quick in-and-out transactions and an easy way to get a refund for an accidental
                                    overcharge? Most customers don’t want to be “wowed;” they want an effortless experience.</p>
                                <p>In this enlightening keynote session, Matt Dixon, co-author of <em>The Effortless Experience</em>, will explain how a company’s ability to deliver on basic promises and solve day-to-day problems drives customer loyalty.
                                    He will share case studies that will inspire us to conquer the new battleground for customer loyalty.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stephen M. R. Covey</strong> is a cofounder of CoveyLink and the FranklinCovey Speed of Trust Practice. A sought-after and compelling keynote speaker and advisor on trust, leadership, ethics and high performance, he speaks
                        to audiences around the world. He is the <em>New York Times</em> and #1 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestselling author of <em>The SPEED of Trust</em>, a groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting book that challenges our age-old assumption
                        that trust is merely a soft, social virtue and instead demonstrates that trust is a hard-edged, economic driver. He and business partner Greg Link also co- authored <em>Smart Trust: The Defining Skill That Transforms Managers Into Leaders</em>,
                        which shares enlightening principles and anecdotes of people and organizations that are achieving unprecedented success from high-trust relationships and cultures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Covey is the former CEO of Covey Leadership Center, which, under his stewardship, became the largest leadership development company in the world. He personally led the strategy that propelled his father's book, Dr. Stephen R. Covey's
                        <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, to one of the two most influential business books of the 20th Century, according to <em>CEO Magazine</em>. A Harvard MBA, he joined Covey Leadership Center as a client developer
                        and later became national sales manager and then president & CEO.</p>
                    <p>Under his direction, the company grew rapidly and profitably, achieving Inc. 500 status. As president &amp; CEO, he nearly doubled revenues to over $110 million while increasing profits by 12 times. During that period, both customer
                        and employee trust reached new highs and the company expanded throughout the world into over 40 countries. This greatly increased the value of the brand and company. The company was valued at only $2.4 million when Covey was named
                        CEO, and, within three years, he grew shareholder value to $160 million in a merger he orchestrated with then Franklin Quest to form FranklinCovey.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, Mr. Covey has gained considerable respect and influence with executives and leaders of Fortune 500 companies as well as with mid- and small-sized private sector and public sector organizations he has consulted. Clients
                        recognize his unique perspective on real-world organizational issues based on his practical experience as a former CEO.</p>
                    <p>Covey currently serves on the board/advisory board of several entities, including the Human Performance Institute—the leader in energy management technology—where he serves as advisory board chairman.</p>

                    <p><strong>Andrew Dillon</strong>, a longtime disciple of Dr. Shigeo Shingo and of management improvement in general, has been helping organizations in North America, Europe and Asia for three decades to strengthen individual and collective
                        capacities for continual betterment.</p>
                    <p>By way of a fortuitous encounter in the early 1980s, Mr. Dillon became Dr. Shingo’s principal interpreter and translator in the United States until his death in 1990. Through the 1990s, Mr. Dillon collaborated with a broad array of
                        other management improvement pioneers from Japan, and, with Productivity Press, was responsible for the translation into English of seminal Japanese-language works on the Toyota Production System, total productive maintenance and
                        other topics.</p>
                    <p>In addition to teaching and guiding organizations in fields ranging from glassmaking to information processing to silviculture, Mr. Dillon has over the years lectured on a diversity of management improvement topics. In multiple roles,
                        he remains both an engaged student and an active participant in the distinctive revolution that continues to move outward from the work of Dr. Shingo and leaders of the Toyota Motor Corporation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon earned postgraduate degrees in historical linguistics and public health. He teaches and lectures in English, French, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.</p>

                    <p><strong>John Black</strong> is one of the nation’s leading authorities on lean operations. Most recently, his consulting team worked to deploy the Saskatchewan Healthcare Management System, based on the Toyota Management System, across
                        the province. The Saskatchewan Healthcare Management System employs 43,000 healthcare professionals in approximately 270 facilities, serving 1.1 million residents with an annual budget of $5 billion. In just three years, this implementation
                        significantly reduced healthcare defects, increased capacity and saved millions of dollars.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Black’s career of service to country and corporate America spans almost five decades. He is a lean pioneer who has become known as an expert on the application of lean operations to the healthcare industry. Through his consulting
                        work, major healthcare systems such as Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle and Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis have proven that lean principles profoundly enhance patient satisfaction and organizational safety,
                        quality, efficiency and profitability. Substantially as a result of the work of John Black and Associates, Virginia Mason was named “Top Hospital of the Decade in 2010” by the Leapfrog Group.</p>
                    <p>In the 1980s, Mr. Black was a pioneer of lean operations at Boeing and appointed to President Reagan’s White House Council on Productivity, among other honors. Through principles and procedures recommended by Mr. Black, the Boeing
                        757 program enjoyed substantial improvements in costs, methods and employee morale detailed in a <em>Harvard Business Review</em> case study. Perhaps his greatest achievement at Boeing was helping innovate the first moving assembly
                        line in aerospace, one based on Toyota Production System (lean) principles.</p>
