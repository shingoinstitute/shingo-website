    <p>Lean leaders around the world invest substantial time and money on change initiatives that achieve positive results. Most often, they find it is hard to sustain momentum. Each new Lean tool becomes another possible solution or "best practice" only to create a temporary boost in results and a small taste of victory. It doesn’t take many such cycles for associates to feel jaded, frustrated and even burnt out.</p>
    <p>The <em>Shingo Model™</em> is <u>not</u> an additional Lean program or change initiative to implement. Rather, it introduces the 10 <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em> on which to anchor your current initiatives. It fills the gaps in your efforts towards ideal results and enterprise excellence.</p>

	        <h2>Respect Every Individual</h2>
	        <p>Respect must become something that is deeply felt for and by every person in an organization. Respect for every individual naturally includes respect for customers, suppliers, the community and society in general. Individuals are energized when this type of respect is demonstrated. Most associates will say that to be respected is the most important thing they want from their employment. When people feel respected, they give far more than their hands—they give their minds and hearts as well.</p>
					<p>To better understand the principle of respect for every individual simply ask the question “why?” The answer is because we are all human beings with worth and potential. Because this is true, every individual deserves my respect.</p>

      		<h2>Lead With Humility</h2>
          <p>One common trait among leading practitioners of enterprise excellence is a sense of humility. Humility is an enabling principle that precedes learning and improvement. A leader’s willingness to seek input, listen carefully and continuously learn creates an environment where associates feel respected and energized and give freely of their creative abilities. Improvement is only possible when people are willing to acknowledge their vulnerability and abandon bias and prejudice in their pursuit of a better way.</p>

					<h2>Focus on Process</h2>
					<p>All outcomes are the consequence of a process. It is nearly impossible for even good people to consistently produce ideal results with a poor process both inside and outside the organization. There is natural tendency to blame the people involved when something goes wrong or is less than ideal, when in reality the vast majority of the time the issue is rooted in an imperfect process, not the people.</p>

            <h4 class="roboto">Ideal Results Require Ideal Behaviors</h4>
            <p>Results are the aim of every organization, but there are various methods by which they are attained. Ideal results are those that are sustainable over the long-term. Simply learning or buying new tools or systems does not achieve ideal results. Great leaders understand the cause-and-effect relationship between results and behavior. To achieve ideal results, leaders must do the hard work of creating an environment where ideal behaviors are evident in every associate.</p>

            <h4 class="roboto">Purpose and Systems Drive Behavior</h4>
            <p>It has long been understood that our beliefs have a profound effect on our behavior. What is often overlooked, however, is the equally profound effect that systems have on behavior. Most of the systems that guide the way people work in our companies were designed to create a specific business result without regard for the behavior that the system consequentially drives. Many systems are de-facto systems that have evolved in response to a specific need for a particular result. Managers have an enormous job to realign both management and work systems to drive the ideal behavior required to achieve ideal business results.</p>

      <div class="four columns">
          <h6 class="roboto">Insight #3</h6>
            <h4 class="roboto">Principles Inform Ideal Behaviors</h4>
            <p>Principles are foundational rules and help us to see both the positive and negative consequence of our behaviors. This fact enables us to make more informed decisions, specifically, about how we choose to behave. The more deeply leaders, managers and associates understand the principles of operational excellence and the more perfectly systems are aligned to reinforce ideal behavior, the greater the probability of creating a sustainable culture of excellence where achieving ideal results is the norm rather than the aspiration. This is what the <em>Shingo Model™</em> illustrates.</p>
