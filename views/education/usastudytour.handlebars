		<h4 class="roboto">Overview</h4>
		<p>Throughout this tour, we will immerse you in the lean culture of many organizations pursuing enterprise excellence. The Shingo Study Tour to the USA is designed to open your eyes, broaden your vision, deepen your understanding of lean principles, systems
			and tools; ultimately, transforming attitudes about what is possible by utilizing the <em>Shingo Model</em>™. You will gain a deeper understanding of the Model and the underlying principles behind the Shingo philosophy and approach. You will learn
			and gain a deeper understanding of how to define principle-behavior and what to look for as we tour various facilities. You will also understand the key elements of behavior as we further discuss and look at what drives the behavior – the systems.</p>
		<p>This tour creates a new lens for many to truly see beyond the tools and discover what is at the root of enterprise excellence cultures.</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			After each company tour the group will discuss and document:
			<ul class="square">
				<li>Best practices that were observed and the principles behind them</li>
				<li>The driving system(s) behind the behaviors</li>
				<li>How systems could be adapted in your own organization to drive desired behaviors</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4 class="roboto">Company Tours</h4>
		<p>We will be visiting world class companies and organizations such as Virginia Mason Medical Center, University of Washington, Boeing, OC Tanner, Barnes Aerospace, and Autoliv. Click the logo to learn more</p>
