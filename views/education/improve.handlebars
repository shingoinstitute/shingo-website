    <p>This three-day workshop integrates classroom and on-site experiences at a host facility to build upon the knowledge and experience gained at the DISCOVER EXCELLENCE workshop. It begins by teaching you how to clearly define value through the eyes of your customers. It continues the discussion about ideal behaviors, fundamental purpose and behavioral benchmarks as they relate to the principles of Continuous Improvement, and takes you deeper into the <em>Shingo Modelâ„¢</em> by focusing on the principles identified in the Continuous Improvement dimension:
