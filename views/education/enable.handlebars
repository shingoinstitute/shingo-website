    <h2><strong>CULTURAL ENABLERS</strong></h2>
    <p> This two-day workshop integrates classroom and on-site experiences at a host facility to build upon the knowledge and experience gained at the DISCOVER EXCELLENCE workshop. It takes you deeper into the <em>Shingo Modelâ„¢</em> by focusing on the principles identified in the Cultural Enablers dimension:
        <ul class="square">
            <li>Respect Every Individual</li>
            <li>Lead with Humility</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p id="improve">Cultural Enablers principles make it possible for people in an organization to engage in the transformation journey, progress in their understanding and ultimately build a culture of enterprise excellence. Enterprise excellence cannot be achieved through top-down directives or piecemeal implementation of tools. It requires a widespread organizational commitment. The CULTURAL ENABLERS workshop will help you define ideal behaviors and the systems that drive them using behavioral benchmarks.</p>
