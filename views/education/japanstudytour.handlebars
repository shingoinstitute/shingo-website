    	<h4 class="roboto">Overview</h4>
        <p>As a participant of the Shingo Study Tour to Japan, you will see and experience first-hand what is at the heart of the lean business model through a series of plant tours, workshops and peer networking.</p>
        <p>The tour begins with an overview of the <em>Shingo Model™</em> and a cultural background session so you can understand the context within which the companies you visit operate as well as how best to conduct yourself in your new surroundings.</p>
        <p>We then give you an inside look at world-class companies and allow you to meet the leaders that have catalyzed lean transformations of their own. Our tour hosts will keep you engaged and challenged as you debrief after each visit and define key takeaways that you can apply to your organization’s efforts. You will see the tools and systems of operational excellence in action – you will visit companies that demonstrate excellence in the fundamentals such as 5S, visual management, problem solving, standardized work, quality at the source, safety, continuous flow, intelligent automation and much more.</p>
        <p>Always invited to join us are guest hosts, often Shingo Research Award recipients, that will be available to engage in intellectually stimulating dialogues throughout the week and conduct a seminar on their work as experts in the field of continuous improvement.</p>
        <p><strong>**WE ALSO OFFER</strong> private study tours for groups of 12 or more in the U.S.A, Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, and Denmark. The agenda can be customized by your organization. All tours include site visits to Shingo recipient companies as well as instruction from the Shingo Institute staff.

To Mr. Kosaka, who continues to pursue the principles of TPS, the driving force of ‘kaizen’ (continuous improvement) has always been people. His motto goes like this: “If you want someone to work, show him how to do it, explain it, let him try it, and don’t forget to praise him if he does a good job.” Mr. Kosaka is also an expert in machining and assembly and was taught by Shigeo Shingo.</p>

                                <p>Under the motto, “The development of a company starts with the development of human resources,” AVEX trains engineers who can machine and grind components on a micron scale. Their high skills enable AVEX to operate an integrated system to produce everything from prototypes to mass-produced products. In fiscal year 2006, AVEX was selected as one of the “A Selection of 300 of Japan’s Monozukuri (Manufacturing) SMEs.”</p>
                                <p>Hydraulic control valves for automotive transmission systems require extremely high precision to ensure their accurate sliding movement in the systems. The valve outer diameter tolerance must be within just +/-0.0008 mm. The smooth acceleration and deceleration of automatic cars depends on AVEX’s technologies embodied in these valves that are almost the same size as a finger.</p>
