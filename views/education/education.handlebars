            <p>Leaders quickly find that lean tools such as six sigma, jidoka, SMED, 5S, JIT, quality circles, etc., are not independently capable of effecting lasting change.</p>
            <p>Since 1988 we’ve seen first hand how quickly tool-based organizations decline in their ability to sustain results. On the other hand, organizations that anchor their improvement initiatives to principles – or understand the “why” behind the “how” and the “what” – experience significantly different results.</p>
            <p>To best illustrate our findings, we developed the <em><a href="model#download">Shingo Model™</a></em>, the accompanying <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em> and the <em>Three Insights of Enterprise Excellence</em>. The five Shingo workshops described below are designed with the input of many seasoned instructors, leaders and consultants to help you transform your organization's culture to one of continuous improvement and operational excellence.</p>

        <h2 id="discover">Shingo Workshops</h2>
        <p>Learn more about how the <em>Shingo Model</em> can drive your culture toward enterprise excellence by attending the Shingo Workshop Series, which includes five workshops. The first workshop in the series, Discover Excellence, is a prerequisite and provides the foundational understanding of the <em>Shingo Model</em> and the 10 <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em>. The following three workshops – Cultural Enablers, Continuous Improvement and Enterprise Alignment & Results – can be taken in any order. These workshops take participants deeper into the <em>Shingo Model</em> and provide a more profound understanding of the ideal behaviors necessary to achieve ideal results within an organization. BUILD EXCELLENCE is the capstone workshop that takes all the detailed learnings from the previous Shingo workshops and teaches participants how to build systems that drive behavior which will consistently deliver desired results.

        <h5><strong>DISCOVER EXCELLENCE</strong></h5>
        <p>This foundational, two-day workshop introduces the <em>Shingo Model</em>, the <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em> and the <em>Three Insights to Enterprise Excellence™</em>. With active discussions and on-site learning at a host organization, this program is a highly interactive experience. It is designed to make your learning meaningful and immediately applicable as you discover how to release the latent potential in an organization to achieve enterprise excellence. It provides the basic understanding needed in all Shingo workshops; therefore, it is a pre-requisite to all the other workshops, and concludes with the BUILD EXCELLENCE workshop.</p>

        <h5><strong>CULTURAL ENABLERS</strong></h5>
        <p> This two-day workshop integrates classroom and on-site experiences at a host facility to build upon the knowledge and experience gained at the DISCOVER EXCELLENCE workshop. It takes you deeper into the <em>Shingo Model™</em> by focusing on the principles identified in the Cultural Enablers dimension:
            <ul class="square">
                <li>Respect Every Individual</li>
                <li>Lead with Humility</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p id="improve">Cultural Enablers principles make it possible for people in an organization to engage in the transformation journey, progress in their understanding and, ultimately build a culture of enterprise excellence. Enterprise excellence cannot be achieved through top-down directives or piecemeal implementation of tools. It requires a widespread organizational commitment. The CULTURAL ENABLERS workshop will help you define ideal behaviors and the systems that drive them using behavioral benchmarks.</p>

It begins by teaching you how to clearly define value through the eyes of your customers. It continues the discussion about ideal behaviors, fundamental purpose and behavioral benchmarks as they relate to the principles of Continuous Improvement, and takes you deeper into the <em>Shingo Model™</em> by focusing on the principles identified in the Continuous Improvement dimension:

        <h5><strong>ENTERPRISE ALIGNMENT &amp; RESULTS</strong></h5>
        <p>This two-day workshop integrates classroom and on-site experiences at a host facility to build upon the knowledge and experience gained at the DISCOVER EXCELLENCE workshop. It takes you deeper into the <em>Shingo Model™</em> by focusing on the principles identified in the Enterprise Alignment dimension and the Results dimension:</p>

          <li>Create Value for the Customer</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="build">
            To succeed, organizations must develop management systems that align work and behaviors with principles and direction in ways that are simple, comprehensive, actionable and standardized. Organizations must get results, and creating value for customers is ultimately accomplished through the effective alignment of every value stream in an organization. The ENTERPRISE ALIGNMENT & RESULTS workshop continues the discussion around defining ideal behaviors and the systems that drive them, understanding fundamental beliefs and using behavioral benchmarks.
