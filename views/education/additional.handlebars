    <h3>Gwendolyn Galsworth's Visual Workplace</h3>
    <p>The visual workplace is a compelling operational imperative, crucial to meeting production goals— central to your war on waste, vastly reduced lead times, and an accelerated flow. The result is a self-ordering, self-explaining, and self-regulating workplace where what is supposed to happen does happen—on time, every time, day or night—because of visual solutions. An effective visual conversion can increase productivity by a documented 15% to 30%. Far too many companies, however, focus on point solutions only and miss visuality’s capacity to transform and sustain.</p>
