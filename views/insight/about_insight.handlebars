              <h2>Ideal Behaviors</h2>
              <p>The way people behave when they come to work has a direct impact on the bottom-line of any organization. Successful organizations have systems 
                  that drive their culture ever closer to ideal behavior and ideal results. The desired outcome of aligning behaviors (the culture) with principles 
                  of operational excellence result in continuously improving quality, cost, delivery, customer satisfaction, morale, safety and environment, or in other 
                  words, value for the stakeholder.</p>

        <h2>Shingo Insight Assessment</h2>
        <p>The Shingo Institute has been assessing organizational performance for over 30 years and has developed a methodology for determining the degree to which an organization 
            believes the behaviors of its leaders, managers and associates are aligned with the principles of the <em>Shingo Model™</em>. It is a simple methodology, such that 
            any organization can easily evaluate itself on a regular basis to help determine if the changes they are making to their systems are actually changing the culture
             (behavior) and impacting value to the customer (results). Shingo Insight Assessment is an organization’s internal view of its culture, 
             as opposed to a <a href="https://www.shingo.org/awards">third-party assessment</a>.</p>
        <h2>About Shingo Insight Assessment</h2>
        <p>Shingo Insight Assessment is a web-delivered assessment that looks at the entire organization - leaders, managers and associates - and compares their behaviors to the
             <em>Shingo Model</em>. The assessment helps managers improve the consistency of their execution and performance by measuring and addressing specific factors 
             surrounding the ten guiding principles of the <em>Shingo Model</em>. Furthermore...</p>
        <ul class="no-bullets">
