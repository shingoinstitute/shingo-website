	<h2>The Details</h2>
        <p>The assessment is comprised of an approximately 20-minute online survey. The main section of the assessment is based on the principles of the <em>Shingo Model</em>. Each principle has three behavioral benchmarks followed by two to three questions, as in the screenshot below.</p>

        <p>In order to get a meaningful sample, we ask that all leaders and managers in the surveying entity take the assessment.</p>
        <p>The number of associates that will need to take the survey will depend on the size of the organization and the breakdown provided by the organization.</p>
        <p>The assessment report currently has two levels of detail: a high-level executive summary and a question-level analysis. More information and images on the reporting will be released soon.</p>
