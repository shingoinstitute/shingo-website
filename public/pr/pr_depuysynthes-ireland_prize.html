        <p>IRELAND – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded DePuySynthes Ireland with the Shingo Prize.</p>
        <p>“When an organization receives the Shingo Prize, it is a symbol of their successful creation of a culture anchored on principles of excellence–principles such as respect, humility, the quest for perfection, the flow of value to the customer, etc.,” said Robert Miller, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Performance is measured both in terms of business results and the degree to which business, management and work systems are driving appropriate and ideal behaviors at all levels. Ultimately, these are some of the best organizations in the world.” </p>
        <p>Part of the DePuySynthes subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the plant in Cork, Ireland, predominantly manufactures hip, knee and shoulder replacements. With a sudden increase in demand in 2005, the plant felt a need to establish a more responsive and flexible manufacturing facility. With this goal in mind, it began a cultural, physical and organizational transformation. </p>
        <p>“I joined DePuySynthes 10 years ago, and the changes that have occurred culturally, physically and organizationally through our operational excellence journey have transformed our site into a world class manufacturing facility,” said Joe Healy, business transformation manager. “Challenging for the Shingo Prize really helped our organization raise the bar and strive for ‘world-class’ in everything we do. Getting the Shingo Prize is great recognition for the work that we have completed to-date but only makes us more determined to continue to strive for operational excellence in the future.”</p>
        <p>“Achieving the Shingo Prize has not only provided recognition and reward for our dedicated continuous improvement journey, but also a planned framework for ongoing future improvements,” said Pat Dunphy, business transformation specialist. “Adopting the Shingo Model during our [continuous improvement] journey truly united the organization and provided a framework for targeted improvement driving key business results.” </p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results. </p>
        <p>“In providing recognition, the Shingo Institute invites organizations to challenge early in their implementation of improvement efforts,” Miller said. “Doing so provides them valuable feedback to help accelerate their implementation. By understanding the principles we teach, organizations can begin to proactively change their culture. Culture is the key to sustainable operational excellence.”</p>
        <p>DePuySynthes Ireland will receive the Shingo Prize at the Awards Ceremony and Gala during the 26th International Shingo Conference, May 5-9, 2014 in Sandusky, Ohio. The awards gala is the conclusion to this five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
