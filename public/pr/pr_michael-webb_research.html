        <h5><strong><em>Sales Process Excellence</em> by Michael Webb Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
				<p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of his book, Michael Webb has been selected as recipient of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The author will receive the award at the 27th Shingo International Conference occurring May 4-8, 2015.</p>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah— The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Michael Webb with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for his work <em>Sales Process Excellence.</em> Webb is president of Sales Performance Consultants, Inc., an Atlanta-based thought leader in the emerging field of lean process excellence for sales performance and business growth.</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Mark Baker, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
				<p>In <em>Sales Process Excellence,</em> Webb traces sales and marketing problems to their root causes in traditional management methods. He explains why these methods actually create barriers for leaders, and reveals an alternative that avoids them called sales process excellence. Drawing on years of experience with B2B sales managers, general managers and process excellence leaders, Webb shows how you can engage your team to learn what customers want; design your process to tell you who will buy, who won't, and why; increase margins and accountability, while earning field salespeople's cooperation and respect; synchronize marketing, sales and service into a smooth production flow, and then accelerate it; and use data you didn’t know you had to drive decisions that reliably grow your business. You will learn proven principles for finding customer value and locking in profit in ways competitors can’t imitate, while increasing predictability and reducing business risks.</p>
				<p>"<em>Sales Process Excellence</em> is the first book I've seen that combines deep insight into both sales and marketing AND the lean management philosophy,” says Hank Bonnah, operations manager at Tubelite, Inc. “Webb treats his topic thoroughly; the approaches he describes are valuable for any business. One of the best business books I've read in a long time.”</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. The examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
				<p>Webb will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 27th Shingo International Conference held the week of May 4-8, 2015. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
