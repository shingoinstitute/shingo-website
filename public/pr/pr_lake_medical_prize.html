    	<h3>Lake Region Medical Receives International Recognition for Operational Excellence</h3>
        <h5>February 4, 2016</h5>
        <br>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Lake Region Medical in New Ross, Ireland with the Shingo Bronze Medallion, its second Bronze medallion in four years. </p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Bronze Medallion signifies an organization’s mastery of fundamental tools and techniques for improving an organization's operations,” said Ken Snyder, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Organizations that receive the Bronze Medallion are making great progress on their journey to achieving enterprise excellence.” </p>
				<p>The Shingo Bronze Medallion is the third of three awards bestowed on organizations by the Shingo Institute. The highest achievement is the Shingo Prize. </p>
				<p>As one of the world’s largest medical device outsource manufacturers, Lake Region Medical, a subsidiary of Greatbatch Medical, is an industry expert in developing medical devices for cardiovascular, neurovascular and peripheral vascular applications. The site in New Ross is the largest global manufacturer of diagnostic guide wires, supplying to the medical device industry and currently markets to customers in more than 30 countries worldwide. It is estimated that a Lake Region Medical guide wire is used somewhere in the world every 1.5 seconds. </p>
				<p>Lake Region’s Assembly &amp; Packaging Manager, Colum Sheridan said, “Challenging for the Shingo Prize was a great experience. It instilled great pride and joy in all of us as we looked back at the improvements we had made that brought us to the challenge stage. The weeks prior to the assessment resulted in even greater team and personal bonding as we all wanted to make sure we gave it our best shot to tell the Lake Region story. In my 25 years working in industry this was undoubtedly the most positive work experience I have ever been a part of.”</p>
				<p>Lake Region Medical has noted a number of significant improvements, including a 44% reduction in lost time incidents since 2011, over 90% of all waste being diverted from the landfill, an 85% reduction in manufacturing lead time for its main value stream, and more than 1100 improvement cards closed annually since 2012. </p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results. </p>
				<p> “In providing recognition, the Shingo Institute invites organizations to challenge early in their implementation of improvement efforts,” Snyder said. “Doing so provides them valuable feedback to help accelerate their implementation. By understanding the principles we teach, organizations can begin to proactively change their culture. Culture is the key to sustainable operational excellence.” </p>
				<p>Lake Region will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th Shingo International Conference held the week of April 24-29, 2016. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
