        <p>JUAREZ, Mexico – Ethicon Inc. in Juarez, Mexico is to receive The Shingo Prize from The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence, which is part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University.</p>
        <p>The Shingo Prize, the highest honor from The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence, is awarded to organizations that demonstrate a culture where principles of operational excellence are deeply embedded into the thinking and behavior of all leaders, managers, and associates. Performance is measured both in terms of business results and the degree to which business, management, and work systems are driving ideal behavior at all levels. </p>
        <p>Ethicon has been the world leader in manufacturing of surgical sutures for over a century with a total share of over 80% of the global market. The Ethicon Juarez facility initiated operations in 1999 and has grown as a direct result of its outstanding quality, service, and competitive productivity. Ethicon Juarez operations produce a significant portion of the total Ethicon worldwide suture volume. </p>
        <p>“Our people are very proud of the continuous improvement culture mindset we have at our site. The Shingo Prize is a great recognition for their hard work during all these years. Ethicon is truly a center of excellence,” said Edgar Vazquez, PE Manager at Ethicon Juarez.</p>
        <p>As a result of its operational excellence efforts, Ethicon Juarez has achieved zero recalls in the past 10 years for the Suture Business Unit, and has an annual turnover rate which is 90% lower than the average labor turnover rate in Juarez. With over a 97% line item fill rate during the last 3 years, Ethicon has also reduced its cycle time by 30% over the last 3 years. And, Ethicon launched the Women’s Leadership Initiative (WLI), Hispanic Organization for Leadership &amp; Achievement (HOLA), and “Comite de la Comunidad” (Community Committee) affinity groups to help management achieve business impact activities.</p>
        <p>Ethicon Juarez will be awarded The Shingo Prize at the 25th Annual Shingo Prize Awards Gala, during the Annual International Conference May 6-10, 2013. The awards gala is the conclusion to this four-day operational-excellence-centered event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers, and breakout sessions that will provide ongoing knowledge, insights, and experience for organizations on their transformation to operational excellence. </p>
        <p>“The Shingo Prize is a recognition program that identifies organizations doing exceptional work in business improvement,” said Robert Miller, Executive Director of The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence. “The intent is to motivate others to learn from them. The Prize focuses on building excellence throughout the entire business enterprise. To achieve The Shingo Prize, organizations compete against the most rigorous standards in the world, rather than against each other.”</p>
