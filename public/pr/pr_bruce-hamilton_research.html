        <h5><strong>“Improvement Kata” by Bruce Hamilton and Bill Costantino Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
        <p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of their video, Bruce Hamilton and Bill Costantino have been selected as recipients of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The author will receive the award at the 28th International Shingo Conference in the spring of 2016.</p>
        <p>LOGAN, Utah— The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Bruce Hamilton and Bill Costantino with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for their work “Improvement Kata: Making Scientific Thinking a Life Skill for Everyone.” Hamilton is the president of GBMP, Inc., and Costantino is the founder and senior partner for W3 Group, LLC.</p>
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Mark A. Baker, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
        <p>Using an example familiar to most – learning to drive, GBMP's “Improvement Kata” video compares traditional ‘push system’ learning with the improvement kata method, which redefines the manager’s role as coach and enabler. Many humorous moments in Anna's learning process underscore the benefits of the structured, scientific kata approach. In the end, Anna learns a valuable ‘meta-skill,’ a deliberate, scientific method that can be universally applied to any challenge she may face. Whether in our work or personal lives, achieving challenging goals requires a set of practiced skills and a social environment that supports a scientific approach to problem solving. The challenge to kaizen, small changes for the better, is that it requires a set of practiced skills that create a social environment supporting the technical science of problem solving. This video of Anna's driving lessons provides an introduction to the critical importance of kata methodology to real human development. </p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
        <p>Hamilton and Costantino will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in 2016. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>

        <h5><strong>Testimonials</strong></h5>
				<p>“The GBMP team clearly defines the premise of the process by contrasting it with traditional approaches that have not worked. Even though improvement and coaching kata has been around for some time, the video brings forward a very simple method for implementation to the masses. The video talks about how scientific thinking cannot only be valuable at work; it can and should be used in our daily lives.” <em>– Mark Loscudo, VP Operations, Smith-Midland</em></p>
				<p>“Because of the Improvement Kata DVD I understood that for this project that first the coach needs to be very patient, &amp; the learner needs to clearly understand the objective, and to have the right coach to teach you with their knowledge of it.” <em>- Matilde Lebron, Production Manager &amp; Current Learner</em></p>
				<p>“GBMP’s DVD on the Kata method answers the question in our minds “how might it play out.”  This is an important insight that emboldened us when we decided to try it for ourselves!” <em>- Jason McKinney, Corporate CI Manager, The Gem Group</em></p>
				<p>“The video makes learning about problem solving more Socratic and interesting. This will by itself create more thought and motivation as compared to just reading a book.” <em>-Anonymous</em></p>
				<p>“The strength of the video comes from teaching practitioners the human aspect of implementing sustainable change by following a process of involving people in the kaizen process through identifying the goals, identifying challenges, and performing experiments until the desired improvements are realized.” <em>-Anonymous</em></p>
