        <h5><strong>“Toyota’s 8-Steps to Problem Solving” by Robert Goldsmith Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
        <p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of his work, Robert H. Goldsmith has been selected as recipient of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The author will receive his award at the 28th International Shingo Conference in the spring of 2016.</p>
        <p>LOGAN, Utah— The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Robert H. Goldsmith with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for the book, “Toyota’s 8-Steps to Problem Solving.” Goldsmith is the founder of V.O.C Lean Solutions, Inc. </p>
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Mark A. Baker, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
        <p>“Toyota’s 8-Steps to Problem-Solving” is a how-to book. The content explains Toyota’s methodology for problem solving that has been proven as a very effective approach. The book lays out Toyota’s eight steps to problem solving and describes specific tools and how to utilize them in a problem-solving initiative. The book includes an easy-find reference section to “mentally prompt or remind” the reader on the correct steps and tools recommended. The intent for this book is to inspire the reader to incorporate the Toyota 8-step A3 thinking methodology into their business processes to take their organization to the next level.</p>
        <p>“This is one of the best books written on the subject of A3 and PDCA,” says David Humble, director of process governance at Baylor Scott &amp; White Health in Washington, D.C. Regional director of performance improvement at St. Vincent Healthcare in Billings, MT, Debbie Dobson says, “This easy-to-read, practical primer is a recommended read for anyone interested in taking the mystery out of A3 thinking. Bob's book demonstrates the history and relationship between PDCA and A3 problem solving in an easy, digestible way and includes examples from both healthcare and manufacturing.”</p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
        <p>Goldsmith will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in 2016. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
