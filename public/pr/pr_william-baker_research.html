				<p>LOGAN, Utah — The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded William H.

				<p>Baker and Rolfes have been deeply involved in leading lean transformations that last in today’s ever-changing business landscape. In their book, “Lean for the Long Term,” they present a lean management system model that encompasses leadership, process and growth as the model to drive business performance. The authors investigate the fragile nature of a lean culture and the resulting effects on people and the company when culture shifts. They illustrate the methods several companies have used to achieve successful lean transformations that last and also offer guidance on how to build your own action plan based on the best practices outlined in the text. </p>
				<p>Luke Faulstick, co-owner, president and CEO at PPI says, “’Lean for the Long Term’ is one of the only books which presents lean as a comprehensive business model and not just a set of tools in a toolbox. An engaging read that will help any company maximize its full business potential. It is a must-read for business leaders, C-suite executives and board members.” </p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards. </p>
				<p>The authors will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in Washington D.C.
