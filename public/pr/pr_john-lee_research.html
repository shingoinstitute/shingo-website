        <h5><strong>“Rising Above It All” by John Lee Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
				<p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of his work, John L. Lee has been selected as recipient of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The author will receive his award at the 28th International Shingo Conference in the spring of 2016.</p>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah— The Shingo Institute, part of the <a href="http://www.huntsman.usu.edu/">Jon M. Huntsman School of Business</a> at Utah State University, has awarded John L. Lee with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for the book, “Rising Above It All: The Art and Science of Organizational Transformation.” Lee is a veteran business consultant and the president of Alpha Training and Consulting, a full service consulting firm. </p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
				<p>“Rising Above It All” looks at organizational transformation in a revolutionary new way that can help you promote a higher level of sustained performance. Lee provides inspiring and informative techniques that help you improve business operations. You can learn how to understand and modify bad behaviors, formulate a true definition of leadership, and create a model that leads to cultural change. This guide includes figures and diagrams and provides a mathematical argument for why organizations must change in order to further progress. It examines historical figures whose insights have changed the world – and what you can learn from them. Much more than a rehash of old ideas introduced in flashy new clothing, this guide seeks to revolutionize thinking for organizational needs. If you're interested in organizational and self-improvement, the “Rising Above It All” guidebook provides the case studies, tips and strategies you need to produce results.</p>
				<p>Walt Garvin, vice president of lean six sigma at Jabil Inc. says, “‘Rising Above It All’ is a masterful work that lays a solid foundation for a lean transformation. John Lee provides extraordinary insights into personal, tools and cultural transformation that build a lean trajectory relevant to any organization. Through applying John's key points, we have been able to transform a global company into one that is excelling in ways that benefit our customers to new levels.” Garvin continues, “I personally found great value in how the book frames the history of transformation, so that one can fully appreciate the current context that we live in today. Moreover, John Lee describes the human condition in easy-to-understand ways that provide value to the overall objective: creating opportunities for our customers, our employees, the communities we operate in, and the society at large. This is a must-read book for anyone serious about organizational transformation to a higher level of performance.”</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
				<p>Lee will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in 2016. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
