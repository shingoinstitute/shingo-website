        <h5><strong>“Customer Focused Process Innovation” by David Hamme Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
        <p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of his book, David Hamme has been selected as recipient of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University. The author will receive the award at the 28th International Shingo Conference in the spring of 2016.</p>
        <p>LOGAN, Utah— The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded David Hamme with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for his work “Customer Focused Process Innovation: Linking Strategic Intent to Everyday Execution.” Hamme is the founder and managing director of Ephesus Consulting, which specializes in driving game-changing initiatives for its clients.</p>
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Mark A. Baker, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
        <p>In this groundbreaking book, business innovation expert David Hamme reveals a powerful and proven method for connecting your company's value-creation processes to customer-desired products—forging a direct link between strategic intentions and everyday business activities. The goal is to systematize innovation in your company, and “Customer Focused Process Innovation” takes you step-by-step through the details to accomplish this goal. With Hamme as your guide, you'll transform your organization into a process-focused enterprise in which organizational silos, command-and-control management, guesswork, and information inadequacies cease to exist. You can have an organizational culture where intuitive, simplified, fact-based, customer-connected, efficient approaches are the rule, not the exception.</p>
        <p>“David Hamme's book is spot on and insightful in both the concept and practice of how to implement and gain alignment with customer focus, innovation and process,” says Gino Biondi, vice president of sales and marketing at Zenith Products Corporation. “Dave dives straight in by starting out on the process elements necessary to win. Through well-articulated principles he ties utilizing the process toward a customer focus extremely well. This core theme is done with a connect-the-dots thinking that makes it easier to think about how to plow through the biggest challenges, maximize innovation, get cost and quality right, and have the speed-to-market essential to meet customer needs. The step-by-step approach he lays out transforms the complexity of process to a palatable idea you'll want to implement immediately.”</p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
        <p>Hamme will receive his award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in 2016. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
