        <h5><strong>“The Lean Prescription” by Patricia Gabow and Philip Goodman Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
				<p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of their work, Dr. Patricia Gabow and Philip Goodman have been selected as recipients of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The authors will receive their award at the 28th International Shingo Conference occurring April 25-29, 2016.</p>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah — The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Dr. Patricia A. Gabow and Philip L. Goodman with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for their book, “The Lean Prescription: Powerful Medicine for Our Ailing Healthcare System.” Patricia Gabow, M.D., is a professor at the University of Colorado’s School of Medicine and former CEO of Denver Health, a large integrated public healthcare system. Philip Goodman is a 34-year veteran of Denver Health who directed the Lean System group.</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
				<p>“The Lean Prescription” tells the story of how Dr. Gabow led Denver Health to become the first healthcare organization to be awarded the Shingo Bronze Medallion Award. About 10 years into her 20 years as CEO of the healthcare system, Gabow began to look at how one could actually make healthcare work right. After a year of study, she and her team concluded that lean was exactly what healthcare needed. During their seven-year journey that followed, Denver Health dramatically enhanced quality of care and implemented numerous award-winning improvements.</p>
				<p>Throughout the book, Gabow and Goodman provide authoritative guidance on how to effectively implement a lean transformation in a healthcare system that includes hospitals, HMOs, community health centers, call centers and paramedics. Providing an accessible explanation of the lean philosophy and tools, the book includes helpful exercises and examples of lean applications, and goes beyond the hospital environment to the broader healthcare sector.</p>
				<p>Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, says: “Dr. Gabow's amazing process improvements at Denver Health Medical Center were the inspiration for our own journey with lean techniques. Her new book can teach specific techniques to other leaders in the medical field on how to improve their delivery of healthcare, with the focus on where it should be: on patients and their care. In these pages, Dr. Gabow has offered the great gifts of her experience and wisdom. For those with the will to improve, this book can be their guide.”</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
				<p>The authors will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in Washington D.C. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
