        <p>"Receipt of the Shingo Prize is a worldwide recognized symbol of an organization's successful establishment of a culture anchored on principles of enterprise excellence–principles such as respect for every individual, leading with humility, quality at the source, the quest for perfection, creating value for the customer, etc.," said Mark Baker, executive director at the Shingo Institute. "Ultimately, these recipients are in a class of the best organizations in the world, regardless of industry or country."</p>
        <p>Newsprinters – Eurocentral (Scotland) was officially opened in April 2008 by Scotland's First Minister, the Rt. Hon. Alex Salmond and News Corporation executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch. This £56 million investment in Scotland also has the distinction of being the home to the largest and fastest newspaper printing press in the world.</p>
        <p>"The <em>Shingo Model</em>™ has transformed a good company into a great company, by engaging and aligning all staff to that single purpose to be recognized as the best newspaper manufacturer in the world," said Brian McGee, managing director at Newsprinters. "It has been a huge team effort by all staff members."</p>
        <p>As a result of its focus on the organizational culture, Newsprinters – Eurocentral has noted a number of significant improvements, including £1 million savings to the business, 90 percent employee approval of site communications, zero lost time accidents since 2009 and a 30 percent increase in plant efficiency since 2007.</p>
        <p>By "challenging" or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results.</p>
        <p>Newsprinters – Eurocentral will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 27th Shingo International Conference held the week of May 4-8, 2015.
