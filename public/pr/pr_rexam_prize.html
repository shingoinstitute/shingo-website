    	<h3>Rexam Querétaro Receives International Recognition for Operational Excellence</h3>
        <h5>April 20, 2016</h5>
        <br>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Rexam’s facility in Querétaro, Mexico, with the Shingo Prize.</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Prize is a worldwide recognized symbol of an organization's successful establishment of a culture anchored on principles of enterprise excellence–principles such as respect for every individual, leading with humility, quality at the source, the quest for perfection, creating value for the customer, etc.,” said Ken Snyder, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Ultimately, these recipients are in a class of the best organizations in the world, regardless of industry or country.”</p>
				<p>The Rexam plant in Querétaro was formed as a joint venture in September 1995 by Vitro and Rexam. In October 2004, Rexam acquired 100% of the assets, supplying Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean area. With 159 people on site, 140 are involved in plant operations and management, and 19 people are responsible for finance, logistics and sales. The 520,000 sq. ft. facility has three aluminum can manufacturing lines, two for 12-oz. and one for 24-oz. These product lines are dedicated to the major beverage brands we see on retail shelves every day, with a total production of approximately 4 million 12-oz. cans and more than one million 24-oz. cans each day. The plant relentlessly works to exceed customer expectations.</p>
				<p>Hector Marin, marketing and customer service manager at Rexam Querétaro, says, “’Create a Culture of Operational Excellence’ – it’s a long journey that implies full commitment and an everyday focus on continuous improvement. Most important is the focus on our people and our team’s safety and performance. The Shingo Model™ has provided us with a path to follow, aligning our efforts to assure we are creating value in every step we take.”</p>
				<p>“The participation path toward the Shingo Prize was in itself the prize,” says Francisco Vega, logistics manager, Rexam Querétaro. “It opened our eyes to see where and how we should focus efforts. All we needed was to make small adjustments to our principles and processes under the Shingo Model guidelines.”</p>
				<p>The Rexam Querétaro facility has reached a number of noted achievements, including more than 2.6 million work hours without a lost time accident; a 25% reduction in electricity consumption between 2011 and 2015; an engagement score increase from 69% in 2012 to 74% in 2013; and the percentage of deliveries made on time and in full have been maintained at levels close to 100% since 2000.</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results.</p>
				<p>Team members from Rexam Querétaro will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th Shingo International Conference held the week of April 25-29, 2016 in Washington DC. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
