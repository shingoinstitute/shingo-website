    	<h3>Commonwealth Bank of Australia Receives International Recognition for Operational Excellence</h3>
        <h5>February 4, 2016</h5>
        <br>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded a team in the Direct Channels division of Commonwealth Bank of Australia with the Shingo Silver Medallion, the first financial services organization to receive Silver status</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Silver Medallion signifies not only an organization’s mastery of tools and techniques, but also that it has developed mature systems for improving an organization's operations,” said Mark Baker, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Those organizations have shown proficiency in aligning their systems and the collective behaviors of their people with principles and are well on their way to achieving enterprise excellence.” </p>
				<p>The Shingo Silver Medallion is the second of three awards bestowed on organizations by the Shingo Institute. The highest achievement is the Shingo Prize. </p>
				<p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the Group) is one of Australia's leading organizations, providing integrated financial services, including retail, premium, business and institutional banking, funds management, superannuation, insurance, investment and share-broking. The award winning team assists the retail bank’s customers in managing their financial commitments and helping customers get back on track financially.</p>
				<p> “We have been successful by keeping the customer at the heart of what we do,” says Sian Lewis, Executive General Manager. “This is a high performing team, and by transforming some of our business processes, embracing new technologies and instilling a tangible continuous improvement culture we have driven market-leading business benefits and enhanced the service we deliver to our customers.” </p>
				<p>The team has noted a number of significant improvements, including reduced time to verify contract variations, reduced non-value added hand-offs and referral points with vendors, improved employee engagement, and delivered year-on-year operational expense efficiencies.</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results. </p>
				<p>The Group will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th Shingo International Conference held the week of April 24-29, 2016. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
