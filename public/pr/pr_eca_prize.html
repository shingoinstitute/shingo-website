        <h5>May 21, 2015</h5>
        <br>
        <p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Envases Universales Rexam de Centroamérica, S.A. (ECA) in Amatitlán, Guatemala with the Shingo Prize.</p>
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Prize is a worldwide recognized symbol of an organization's successful establishment of a culture anchored on principles of enterprise excellence–principles such as respect for every individual, leading with humility, quality at the source, the quest for perfection, creating value for the customer, etc.,” said Mark Baker, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Ultimately, these recipients are in a class of the best organizations in the world, regardless of industry or country.”</p>
        <p>Partners Envases Universales and Rexam formed ECA as a joint venture in 2007 to manufacture 12-oz. beverage cans. The Guatemala Can Plant has one aluminum can manufacturing line that is fully dedicated to customers such as Coca-Cola, InBev, SAB Miller, Heineken and Pepsi, with a total production of 4.2 million cans a day. The plant’s journey to the Shingo Prize began in 2007 when it adopted Rexam’s commitment to lean enterprise. With a focus on ensuring the organization’s culture reflected the company’s core values, the Guatemala plant has achieved a number of significant accomplishments including: zero lost time accidents since 2010, 95 percent employee satisfaction in the workplace, a 92 percent reduction in customer complaints between 2007 and 2013, and a 100 percent on-time and in-full delivery rate for its customers since 2010.</p>
        <p>“We are very proud of this award and the acknowledgement of the time and effort our people invest every day to maintain a performance-based culture committed to safety, operational excellence, quality and customer satisfaction,” said Joe Gaysinsky, regional manager and plant manager of Rexam’s joint venture with Envases Universales. “We will remain dedicated to these goals as we continue our focus on providing our customers with the best products and services in the industry.”</p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results.</p>
        <p>ECA received the award during the Awards Gala of the 27th Shingo International Conference held the week of May 4-8, 2015 in Provo, Utah. The annual conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
