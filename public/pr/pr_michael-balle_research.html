        <h5><strong>“Lead with Respect” by Michael Ballé and Freddy Ballé Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
				<p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of their work, Michael Ballé and Freddy Ballé have been selected as recipients of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The authors will receive their award at the 28th International Shingo Conference occurring April 25-29, 2016.</p>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah — The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Michael Ballé and Freddy Ballé with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for their business novel, “Lead with Respect: A Novel of Lean Practice.” Michael Ballé is associate researcher at Telecom ParisTech's Project Lean Enterprise and co-founder of the French Lean Institute. Freddy Ballé worked at Renault for 30 years before pioneering a full lean system implementation at Valeo, then Sommer-Allibert as CEO, and later at Faurecia. Michael Ballé and his father Freddy coach CEOs and senior executives in using lean to radically improve their businesses' performance and establish lean culture.</p><p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
				<p>In “Lead With Respect,” the Ballés reveal the true power of lean: developing people through a rigorous application of proven tools and methods, and, in the process, creating the only sustainable source of competitive advantage—a culture of continuous improvement. In this engaging and insightful story, CEO Jane Delaney discovers from her sensei that learning to lead with respect enables her to help people improve every day.</p>
				<p>“Lead with Respect’s” timely message brings a new understanding of lean. While lean has become essential for companies to compete in today’s global economy, most practitioners see it as a rigorous focus on process to produce higher quality goods and services—a limited understanding that fails to realize the true power of this approach. The Ballés new novel, the third in a series that includes Shingo Research Award recipients “The Gold Mine” and “The Lean Manager,” breaks new ground by sharing huge amounts of practical information on the most important yet least understood aspect of lean management: how to develop people through a rigorous application of lean tools.</p>
				<p>Dan Jones, founder of the Lean Enterprise Academy (UK) and co-author of “Lean Thinking,” says, “This is one of the most important books on lean thinking and practice in the last few years. If you read their previous books, you will have not only read gripping stories but also found a very powerful framework for understanding the right way to think and act lean. This book takes you further in understanding one of the most puzzling aspects of TPS and lean, namely what Toyota really means by respect for people and how this is the foundation for learning by doing and continuous improvement. It brings to life the journey to develop your own skills through developing the capabilities of your subordinates which lies at the heart of lean. If you are going to study lean with your colleagues then this is the book I would use. ‘The Machine that Changed the World’ was the clarion call to lean, ‘Lean Thinking’ outlined the principles of lean thinking and ‘Lead with Respect’ will change the way you manage!”</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
				<p>The Ballés will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in Washington D.C. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
        <h5><strong>About the Shingo Institute</strong></h5>
        <p>Housed at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, the Shingo Institute is named after Japanese industrial engineer <a href="http://shingo.org/about/">Shigeo Shingo</a>.

				<h5><strong>Testimonials</strong></h5>
				<p>"The Ballé books are a great way to get started or to speed up your pace of transformation, personal and organizational."
				<em>—Jim Womack, founder, Lean Enterprise Institute, co-author Lean Thinking</em></p>

				<em>—Dan Jones, founder, Lean Enterprise Academy (UK), co-author Lean Thinking</em></p>

				<p>"Lead With Respect is a terrific book that puts the elements of genuine motivation into a broader context and helps leaders translate those principles into action."
				<em>—Daniel H. Pink, author of To Sell Is Human and Drive</em></p>

				<p>Show, don't tell," is the primary dictum of good writing. After trudging through more dry, turgid business books on lean that do quite the opposite, I was thrilled to read Lead with Respect. Michael &amp; Freddy Ballé do a magnificent job of showing (not telling) what leading with respect means and how to do it. We see what respectful leadership looks like in interactions with employees at all levels of an organization.</p>
				<p>There are gems of insight about respectful leadership (and lean, more generally) scattered throughout the book -- and the authors elegantly demonstrate how many of the classic lean tools tie into, and reinforce, the concept of leading with respect.</p>
				<p>If you're looking for one book to show you the true possibility and power of lean -- beyond better financial performance -- this is it.
				<em>—Dan Markovitz, president, Markovitz Consulting, author, A Factory of One</em></p>
