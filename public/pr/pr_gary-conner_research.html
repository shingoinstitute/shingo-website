        <h5><strong>“Lean Epiphanies” by Gary Conner Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award</strong></h5>
        <p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of his work, Gary Conner has been selected as recipient of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The author will receive his award at the 28th International Shingo Conference occurring April 25-29, 2016.</p>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah — The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Gary Conner with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for the book, “Lean Epiphanies: Catapult the Cow and Other Inspirational Continuous Improvement Stories.” Conner is an internationally recognized authority on the subject of manufacturing improvement, with over 30 years of experience. “Lean Epiphanies” is published by SME and available at www.sme.org/epiphanies.</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
				<p>It should not be surprising that the application of world-class manufacturing techniques is even more critical to company survival than it was even a decade ago. In “Lean Epiphanies,” Gary Conner relates inspirational stories of the places he has been, the companies he has worked with, and the people he has met in his Lean Enterprise Training consultancy over the course of more than 20 years. Conner's experience conducting hundreds of continuous improvement events involving thousands of team members led to his writing this fun, easy-to-read collection of short stories.</p>
				<p>Readers will find the conversational style refreshing and the insights transformative and encouraging in their own continuous improvement efforts. Each story relates an "Aha!" moment that teaches something new. Lean newcomers and seasoned practitioners alike will learn through Conner’s compelling insights into human nature, company culture, leadership, and what it takes for business success in the changing dynamics of the new world economy.</p>
				<p>Kristen Smith, a business consultant and coach in Roseburg, Oregon, says, “’Lean Epiphanies’ is a compilation of the best stories of business transformation experienced and told by the best storyteller I have ever met. In reading the book, you experience part of the extraordinary journey companies take learning key lean principles. The continuous improvement processes within can be applied to any business and to all aspects of life.” Smith continues, “The tools we implemented at my organization were a huge success and we continue to generate savings as a result. I highly recommend this book. Through the application of lean techniques, businesses can not only get the edge on the competition, they can grow.”</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.</p>
				<p>Conner will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in Washington D.C. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
