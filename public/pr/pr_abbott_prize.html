    	<h3>Abbott’s Diagnostics Manufacturing Site in Longford, Ireland Receives International Recognition for Operational Excellence</h3>
				<br>
        <h5>February 4, 2016</h5>
        <br>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Abbott’s diagnostics manufacturing facility in Longford with the Shingo Prize.</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Prize is a worldwide recognized symbol of an organization's successful establishment of a culture anchored on principles of enterprise excellence–principles such as respect for every individual, leading with humility, quality at the source, the quest for perfection, creating value for the customer, etc.,” said Ken Snyder, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Ultimately, these recipients are in a class of the best organizations in the world, regardless of industry or country.”</p>
				<p>Abbott’s diagnostics site in Longford manufactures diagnostic tests, also known as reagents, for distribution to hospitals and laboratories around the globe. Its product portfolio includes tests for the detection of thyroid, fertility/pregnancy, cardiology, renal and metabolic markers. Abbott’s Longford facility’s more than 300 employees design, develop and manufacture diagnostic tests to the highest standards of quality.</p>
				<p>Ciaran Corcoran, site director at Abbott Longford says, “The Shingo Model™ has guided the creation of a culture of continuous improvement, which is sustained through principle-based employee behaviors, a common vision and a focused strategy designed to deliver high quality diagnostic tests that are critical to improving healthcare.” He continues, “Every employee at our site shares in the honor of this top Shingo Prize, and it has given us all a great sense of accomplishment.”</p>
				<p>The Abbott Longford facility has reached a number of noted achievements, including more than 22 million euros in cost improvements; a reduction in non-conformance rate by 77%; the implementation of a system that decreased inventory holding by 10% and reduced manufacturing lead times by 38%; 3,454 lost-time accident free days; and a 23% decrease in energy usage in the last four years while increasing production output by 68%.</p>
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results</p>
				<p>Team members from Abbott’s Longford site will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th Shingo International Conference held the week of April 25-29, 2016 in Washington DC. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
