        <h5>April 17, 2015</h5>
        <br>
        <p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded PyMPSA Plásticos y Materias Primas with the Shingo Silver Medallion.</p>
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Silver Medallion signifies not only an organization’s mastery of tools and techniques, but also that it has developed mature systems for improving an organization's operations,” said Mark Baker, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Those organizations are beginning to align their systems and the collective behaviors of their people with principles and are well on their way to achieving enterprise excellence.”</p>
        <p>The Shingo Silver Medallion is the second of three awards bestowed on organizations by the Shingo Institute. The highest achievement is the Shingo Prize.</p>
        <p>PyMPSA, with more than 25 years of experience manufacturing medical devices, is the largest medical device manufacturing company in México and one of many companies that belong to PiSA Group, the biggest Mexican pharmaceutical company. PyMPSA owns 80% of the Mexican market selling around 500,000 medical devices daily, including IV sets, urine bags, dialysis bags, hemodialysis devices, epidural anesthesia kits, etc. </p>
        <p>“Our road toward operational excellence has been hard, but at the same time, full of satisfactions. We made the right decision to embrace the <em>Shingo Model™</em> in order to pursue operational excellence,” said Rafael Franco, industrial engineering/lean manager at PyMPSA. “We are excited to continue on this path that will never end.”</p>
        <p>PyMPSA has noted a number of significant improvements, including a 70% PPM improvement, 98.5% on-time delivery, 30% lead time reduction, 30% safety incidents reduction, as well as a 60% sales growth in three years. </p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results.</p>
        <p>PyMPSA will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 27th Shingo International Conference held the week of May 4-8, 2015. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
