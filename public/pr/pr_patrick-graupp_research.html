        <h5><strong>Reviews</strong></h5>
        <p>LEGO has been a household name all of my life and I was aware that they had a strong people-focused culture and adopted Lean methods. This book, written with LEGO insiders, is a stunning example of the discipline and commitment needed to develop people as masters of their crafts through the only way people learn—repetitive, deliberate practice.<br>
—Jeffrey K. Liker, Professor, University of Michigan; and Shingo Prize-winning author of <em>The Toyota Way</em></p>
		<p>Few books, if any in the Lean area since the NUMMI era, have gone into such depth on what it takes to integrate and unify across cultures. The book will become a standard guide not only to TWI implementation, but to the wider challenge of cross-functional and cross-cultural integration.<br>
—John Bicheno, Founder of MSc in Lean Enterprise at The University of Buckingham</p>
		<p>While TWI has made a significant comeback in recent years as the underpinning of the Toyota Production System’s foundation for continuous improvement and standard work, the ability to make it an integrated and sustainable system of developing people with a highly productive capability to solve problems while continually learning has remained elusive to most organizations. The book describes in detail how LEGO achieve this culture through a strategic and deliberate plan to develop and deploy a global system of organizational training using TWI as its foundation.<br>
—Jim Huntzinger, President/Founder, Lean Frontiers</p>
        <h5><strong>About the Shingo Institute</strong></h5>
        <p>Housed at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, the Shingo Institute is named after Japanese industrial engineer <a href="http://shingo.org/about/">Shigeo Shingo</a>. Shingo distinguished himself as one of the world's thought leaders in concepts, management systems and improvement techniques that have become known as the Toyota Business System. Drawing from Shingo's teachings and years of experience working with organizations throughout the world, the Shingo Institute has developed the <em>Shingo Model™</em> which is the basis for several educational offerings including workshops, study tours and conferences. It also awards and recognizes organizations that demonstrate an exceptional culture that continually strives for improvement and progress.
