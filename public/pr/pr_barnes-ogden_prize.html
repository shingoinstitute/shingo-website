        <br>
        <p>OGDEN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Barnes Aerospace, Ogden Division, a business of Barnes Group Inc., with the Shingo Prize.</p>
        <p>“When an organization receives the Shingo Prize, it is a symbol of their successful creation of a culture anchored on principles of excellence–principles such as respect, humility, the quest for perfection, the flow of value to the customer, etc.,” said Robert Miller, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Performance is measured both in terms of business results and the degree to which business, management and work systems are driving appropriate and ideal behaviors at all levels. Ultimately, these are some of the best organizations in the world.” </p>
        <p>Barnes Aerospace Fabrications specializes in the fabrication and assembly of high temperature alloy, complex airframe and engine components with particular expertise in superplastic, hot and cold forming, welding, milling and cutting technology.</p>
        <p>“Knowing the extremely high standard and rigorous criteria of what it takes to achieve the Shingo Prize level in all facets of your business operations – especially in a job-shop, low volume manufacturing environment – makes the award even that more special,” said Steven Moore, general manager of Barnes Aerospace Fabrications, Ogden, Utah and Lansing, Michigan. “Being recipients of the Shingo Silver Medallion two-and-a-half years ago, we immediately set a renewed goal of doing what we needed to do to win the Shingo Prize. Our management team and all of our associates have worked tirelessly towards operational excellence in everything we do to put us in a position to challenge again for the Shingo Prize. I am so proud of them, who they are and what they represent.”</p>
        <p>As a part of its improvement efforts, Barnes Aerospace Fabrications, Ogden Division has experienced a number of significant achievements including 950,000 hours worked without a lost time accident, a 53-percent reduction in scrap and rework as a percentage of sales, a 55-percent lead time reduction, a 28-percent increase in on-time delivery and an increase in new  product introduction on-time delivery from 74 percent to 100 percent. The site has received numerous awards prior to the Shingo Prize including the Utah Manufacturers Association’s Manufacturer of the Year award as well as the Quality Management System Award in 2013, the Utah Manufacturing Association and Utah Labor Commission Workplace Safety Award for Outstanding Safety in 2012 and the Shingo Silver Medallion in 2011.</p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for a Shingo award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results.</p>
        <p>Barnes Aerospace Fabrications, Ogden Division, will receive the Shingo Prize at the Awards Ceremony and Gala during the 26th International Shingo Conference, May 5-9, 2014 in Sandusky, Ohio. The awards gala is the conclusion to this five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
