        <h5>February 27, 2015</h5>
        <br>
        <p>LOGAN, Utah – The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals Italy S.p.A. (LUPI) with the Shingo Bronze Medallion.</p>
        <p>“Receipt of the Shingo Bronze Medallion signifies an organization’s mastery of fundamental tools and techniques for improving an organization's operations,” said Mark Baker, executive director at the Shingo Institute. “Those organizations that receive the Bronze Medallion have begun their journey to achieving enterprise excellence.”</p>
        <p>The Shingo Bronze Medallion is the third of three awards bestowed on organizations by the Shingo Institute. The highest achievement is the Shingo Prize.</p>
        <p>LUPI is Italy’s first Shingo recipient and is part of Supply Operation and Engineering (SOE) at H. Lundbeck A/S, LUPI’s parent company. LUPI is a chemical manufacturer of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) Intermediates for H. Lundbeck A/S and external customers, as well as a provider of API development and production services to key players in the Life Science Industry. The company has operated in the pharmaceutical business since 1929 and is located in the industrial area of Padova, Italy.</p>
        <p>“Lundbeck strives for the best supply chain in the pharmaceutical industry and Shingo recognition is a testimony to the success of this journey. Lundbeck Pharmaceutical Italy’s recognition and the Shingo recognition of two Lundbeck sites in Denmark in 2012 makes Lundbeck the only pharmaceutical company with the majority of its sites recognized by the Shingo Institute,” said SOE Group Senior Vice President, Lars Bang. He continued, “Great performance in our factories makes it possible for Lundbeck to make an even greater difference for people suffering from brain diseases. This is why we strive for operational excellence every day.”</p>
        <p>Michele Brusegan, a Lundbeck Lean Team facilitator also said, “We are all very proud about the recognition from the Shingo Institute of a Shingo Bronze Medallion. It is an indicator that we are on the right track toward operational excellence.”</p>
        <p>From 2010 to 2014, LUPI has noted a number of significant improvements, including a 21.5% growth in total contribution margin, 23% increase in the number of new APIs, 24% decrease in costs related to waste disposal with a 25% increase in overall output of APIS and Intermediates, as well as an 80% reduction in an already low accident frequency.</p>
        <p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, organizations invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners to thoroughly review their culture and operations. The examiners evaluate the challengers based on a rigorous set of standards and the Shingo Institute awards the organizations according to their assessment results.</p>
        <p>“In providing recognition, the Shingo Institute invites organizations to challenge early in their implementation of improvement efforts,” Baker said. “Doing so provides them valuable feedback to help accelerate their implementation. By understanding the principles we teach, organizations can begin to proactively change their culture. Culture is the key to sustainable operational excellence.”</p>
        <p>LUPI will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 27th Shingo International Conference held the week of May 4-8, 2015. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in their pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
