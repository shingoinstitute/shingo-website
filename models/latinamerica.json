And we underestimate the use of powerful tools that can gain engagement and momentum toward achieving our desired results. We must have a clear roadmap that guides us toward excellence, with change management embedded in it. Throughout this presentation, Rafael Padilla will help you understand the importance of having a clear roadmap for implementation; John Kotter’s 8-step process for leading change through practical examples; and the three elements that drive people based on Daniel Pink’s book, <em>Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</em>. You will also learn about the influence process that helps you change anything, based on Kerry Patterson’s book, <em>Influencer</em>, and you will realize how to apply it all to the transformation plan."
