Innovation may be pursued via the define-measure-analyze-improve control (DMAIC) algorithm whereas design for six sigma<em>&nbsp;(</em>DFSS)<em>&nbsp;</em>applies a<em>&nbsp;</em>define-measure-analyze-design-verify (DMADV)<em>&nbsp;</em>approach.</div><div><!--block-->&nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->Integrated design, innovation and lean approaches provide highly structured and complementary strategies for acquiring, assessing and activating customer, competitor and enterprise intelligence that lead to superior product, system or enterprise innovations and designs that are intended to meet and surpass varied stakeholder expectations, thus driving an enterprise’s quest for a sustainable competitive advantages. This is accomplished through strategic linkage of customer-driven, highly resource efficient approaches that yield nearly perfectly performing processes and products.&nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->&nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->Six sigma integrates strategies and tools from statistics, quality, business, and engineering and has added billions of dollars/euros to enterprise bottom lines across financial, healthcare, military, manufacturing and other economic sectors. Its focus divides into two significant branches – innovation and design – that share a number of tools, techniques and objectives, but that often apply the tools and techniques differently, owing to their differing objectives. The innovation branch of six sigma focuses on significant innovation/redesign in or of existing products, processes and systems while the second branch, referred to as design for six sigma, is directed at design of new products, processes or systems.&nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->&nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->This course provides an overview of the most commonly used six sigma methodology, DMAIC innovation approach, along with integrated consideration of a limited selection of supporting tools. In general, the subject will be approached as one dealing with a value continuum that spans the range from recovery of value sacrificed to poor practices, poor processes, poor partnerships, ad infinitum to creation of new value. &nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->&nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->The content will mainly be presented in discussion format with the expectation that participants will practice some methods in small groups. Addressed topics will include:<br><br></div><ul><li><!--block-->● Innovation, Design and Lean Philosophy&nbsp;</li><li><!--block-->● Voice of the Customer Approaches</li><li><!--block-->● Six Sigma for Innovation &amp; Design: Introduction to DMAIC &amp; DMADV Approaches</li><li><!--block-->● Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA or Deming Wheel) Cycles</li><li><!--block-->● Process Capability and Control</li><li><!--block-->● Select Management &amp; Planning Tools for Innovation &amp; Design</li><li><!--block-->● Failure Modes &amp; Effects Analysis</li></ul><div><!--block-->&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><!--block-->Six sigma approaches are commonly applied in team environments. Similarly, six sigma integrates knowledge and strategies from quality management, engineering, business, and statistics so it is helpful to have a background in these areas, but it is not necessary. Although much of the six sigma methodology and practice is statistically oriented, no recent statistical exposure or practice is expected of participants, as instead, focus will be placed on concepts. Participants should generally be customer/stakeholder-focused.<br><br>Successful completion of this course will facilitate participant understanding of six sigma’s DMAIC approach and the customer focus upon which it is built. Introduction to selected methods will deepen this understanding. At the end of the course, participants will receive a certificate of completion and qualify for eight continuing education credits.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>","detail":"Rick Edgeman","title":"Six Sigma Innovation Workshop"}]}},{"time":"14:00 - 18:30","info":{"name":"Company Tours","detail":[{"speaker":"Metalsa - Apodaca Plant","id":"met-apo","abstract":"<div><!--block-->Within the automotive and commercial vehicle market, Metalsa has proved to be one of the best options in structural component solutions for light and heavy vehicles.
